<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Praise, they say, is stricken dumb
by the greatest names, and also,
we may add, by the greatest deeds.
It is only by the bare simplicity of faithful
narrative that we can hope not to belittle
these.</p>

<p>But yesterday the public had no knowledge
of the great, heroic things accomplished by
the Brigade of Marines (<i>Fusiliers Marins</i>).
They were hidden under a confused mass of
notes, <i>communiqués</i>, instructions and plans of
operations, private letters, and newspaper
articles. It has been no easy task to bring
them to light&mdash;the discreet light permitted
by the censorship. Everything seems simple
and obvious to those who can look at facts in
their logical order and regular sequence. The
historian who has to handle new matter knows
what a labour it is to introduce, or rather to
re-establish, such order and sequence. History<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
has to be written before the philosophy of
history can be evolved.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Our readers must not be surprised, therefore,
to find here only such considerations as are in
direct relation to events. We have been
concerned with facts rather than with ideas.
And in the result nothing will be lost hereby,
for we provide materials ready for use in the
establishment of that war mysticism which
the sombre genius of Joseph de Maistre
presaged, which Vigny showed at work in
certain souls, and which is marked out as our
national religion of to-morrow. It is obvious
that such an immense effort, such prolonged
tension, such whole-hearted sacrifice, as were
demanded from the handful of men with whom
we are concerned, could not have been obtained
by ordinary methods. A special compact
was required, a peculiar state of grace;
the miracle was only possible as the outcome
of a close communion, and, to use the proper
word,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> of a true spiritual fraternity between
men and officers.</p>

<p>True, this fraternity has been manifested in
every branch of the service and on every
battlefield during the course of the present
struggle; but nowhere perhaps has it been so
absolute as among the Marines. They had,
no doubt, been well prepared. The sea is a
perpetual battlefield, and a trench is hardly
more of a prison than a ship. Community of
danger soon creates community of hearts;
how otherwise can we account for the fact
that the most turbulent and individualist of
men become the most perfectly disciplined
on board ship? This is the case with the
Bretons. At Dixmude under the command of
their own officers, retaining not only the
costume, but the soul and the language of
their profession, they were still sailors.
Grouped with them were seamen from all our
naval stations, Bayonne, Toulon, Dunkirk, etc.,
and the battalion of Commander de Sainte-Marie,
formed at Cherbourg, even contained
a fair sprinkling of natives of Les Batignolles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
I had opportunities of talking to several of
these "Parigots," and I should not advise
anyone to speak slightingly of their officers
before them, though, indeed, so few of these
have survived that nine times out of ten
the quip could be aimed only at a ghost.
The deepest and tenderest words I heard
uttered concerning Naval Lieutenant Martin
des Pallières were spoken by a Marine of the
Rue des Martyrs, Georges Delaballe, who was
one of his gunners in front of the cemetery
the night when his machine-guns were jammed,
and five hundred Germans, led by a major
wearing the Red Cross armlet, threw themselves
suddenly into our trenches.</p>

<p>"But why did you love him so?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know.... We loved him because
he was brave, and was always saying things
that made us laugh, ... but above all
because he loved us."</p>

<p>Here we have the secret of this extraordinary
empire of the officers over their men, the
explanation of that miracle of a four weeks'
resistance, one against six, under the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
formidable tempest of shells of every calibre
that ever fell upon a position, in a shattered
town where all the buildings were ablaze, and
where, to quote the words of a <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
correspondent, it was no longer light or dark,
"but only red." When the Boches murdered
Commander Jeanniot, his men were half
crazy. They would not have felt the death
of a father more deeply. I have recently had
a letter sent me written by a Breton lad,
Jules Cavan, who was wounded at Dixmude.
While he was in hospital at Bordeaux he
was visited by relatives of Second-Lieutenant
Gautier, who was killed on October 27 in the
cemetery trenches.</p>

<p>"Dear Sir," he wrote to M. Dalché de
Desplanels the following day, "you cannot
imagine how your visit went to my heart....
On October 19, when my battalion took the
offensive at Lannes, three kilometres from
Dixmude, I was wounded by a bullet in the
thigh. I dragged myself along as best I could
on the battlefield, bullets falling thickly all
around me. I got over about five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
metres on the battlefield and reached the road.
Just at that moment Lieutenant Gautier,
who was coming towards me with a section,
seeing me in the ditch, asked: 'Well, my
lad, what is the matter with you?' 'Oh,
Lieutenant, I am wounded in the leg, and I
cannot drag myself further.' 'Here then,
get on my back.' And he carried me to a
house at Lannes, and said these words, which
I shall never forget: 'Stay there, my lad,
till they come and fetch you. I will let the
motor ambulance men know.' Then he went
off under the fire. Oh, the splendid fellow!"</p>

<p>"The splendid fellow!" Jules Cavan echoes
Georges Delaballe, the Breton, the "Parigot."
There is the same heartfelt ring in the words
of each. And sometimes, as I muse over these
heroic shades, I ask myself which were the
more admirable, officers or men. When Second-Lieutenant
Gautier received orders to take
the place of Lieutenant de Pallières, buried
by a shell in the trench of the cemetery where
Lieutenant Eno had already fallen, he read his
fate plainly; he said: "It's my turn." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
he smiled at Death, who beckoned him. But
I know of one case when, as Death seemed
about to pass them by, the Marines provoked
it; when, after they had used up all their
cartridges and were surrounded in a barn,
twelve survivors only remaining with their
captain, the latter, filled with pity for them,
and recognising the futility of further resistance,
said to his men: "My poor fellows,
you have done your duty. There is nothing
for it but to surrender." Then, disobedient
to their captain for the first time, they
answered: "No!" To my mind nothing
could show more clearly the degree of sublime
exaltation and complete self-forgetfulness to
which our officers had raised the <i>moral</i> of their
men. Such were the pupils these masters in
heroism had formed, that often their own
pupils surpassed them. There was at the
Trouville Hospital a young Breton sailor
called Michel Folgoas. His wound was one
of the most frightful imaginable: the whole
of his side was shaved off by a shell which
killed one of his comrades in the trenches,
who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span> was standing next to him, on November 2.
"I," he remarks in a letter, "was completely
stunned at first. When I came to myself I
walked three hundred metres before I noticed
that I was wounded, and this was only when
my comrades called out: 'Mon Dieu, they
have carried away half your side.'" It was
true. But does he groan and lament over it?
He makes a joke of it: "The Boches were so
hungry that they took a beef-steak out of
my side, but this won't matter, as they have
left me a little."</p>

<p>Multiply this Michel Folgoas by 6,000, and
you will have the brigade. This inferno of
Dixmude was an inferno where everyone
made the best of things. And the <i>battues</i>
of rabbits, the coursing of the red German
hares which were running in front of the army
of invasion, the bull-fights in which our
Mokos impaled some pacific Flemish bull
abandoned by its owners; more dubious
escapades, sternly repressed, in the underground
premises of the Dixmude drink-shops;
a story of two Bretons who went off on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
foraging expedition and were seen coming
back along the canal in broad daylight
towing a great cask of strong beer which they
had unearthed Heaven knows where at a
time when the whole brigade, officers as well
as men, had nothing to drink but the brackish
water of the Yser&mdash;these, and a hundred other
tales of the same kind, which will some day
delight village audiences gathered round festal
evening fires, bear witness that Jean Gouin
(or Le Gwenn, John the White, as the sailors
call themselves familiarly<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>), did not lose his
bearings even in his worst vicissitudes.</p>

<p>Dixmude was an epic then, or, as M. Victor
Giraud proposes, a French <i>geste</i>, but a
<i>geste</i> in which the heroism is entirely
without solemnity or deliberation, where the
nature of the seaman asserts itself at every
turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span> where there are thunder, lightning, rain,
mud, cold, bullets, shrapnel, high explosive
shells, and all the youthful gaiety of the
French race.</p>

<p>And this epic did not come to an end at
Dixmude. The brigade did not ground arms
after November 10. The gaps in its ranks
being filled from the dépôts, it was kept up
to the strength of two regiments, and reaped
fresh laurels. At Ypres and Saint Georges it
charged the troops of Prince Ruprecht of
Bavaria and the Duke of Würtemberg in
succession. Dixmude was but one panel of
the triptych: on the broken apex of the black
capital of the Communiers, on the livid
backgrounds of the flat country about Nieuport,
twice again did the brigade inscribe its
stormy silhouette.</p>

<p>But at Ypres and Saint Georges the sailors
had the bulk of the Anglo-French forces
behind them; at Dixmude up to November 4
they knew that their enterprise was a forlorn
hope. And in their hands they held the fate
of the two Flanders. One of the heroes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
Dixmude, Naval Lieutenant Georges Hébert,
said that the Fusiliers had gained more than a
naval battle there. My only objection to
this statement is its modesty. Dixmude was
our Thermopylæ in the north, as the Grand-Couronné,
near Nancy, was our Thermopylæ
in the east; the Fusiliers were the first and
the most solid element of the long triumphant
defensive which will one day be known as
the victory of the Yser, a victory less decisive
and perhaps less brilliant than that of the
Marne, but not less momentous in its consequences.</p>

<p>The Generalissimo is credited with a dictum
which he may himself have uttered with a
certain astonishment:</p>

<p>"You are my best infantrymen," said he
to the Fusiliers.</p>

<p>We will close with these simple, soldierly
words, more eloquent than the most brilliant
harangues. The brigade will reckon them
among their proudest trophies to all time.</p>

<h2>NOTE</h2>


<p>The sources drawn upon in the following
narrative are of various kinds:
official <i>communiqués</i>, French and
foreign reports, etc. But the majority of our
information was derived from private letters,
collected by M. de Thézac, the modest and
zealous founder of the <i>Abris du Marin</i> (Seamen's
Shelters), from note-books kindly lent
by their owners, and from oral inquiries addressed
to the survivors of Melle and Dixmude.
Whenever possible, we have let our
correspondents speak for themselves. We
regret that the strictest orders have compelled
us to preserve their anonymity, which, however,
we hope may be merely temporary.</p>

<h2>I. TOWARDS GHENT</h2>


<p>On the morning of October 8 two
troop trains passed each other in
the station of Thourout. One contained
Belgian Carabiniers; the other, French
Marines. They exchanged greetings from their
respective lines. The Carabiniers waved their
little yellow-bound caps and cried: "Long
live France!" The sailors replied by hurrahs
in honour of Belgium.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked a Belgian
officer.</p>

<p>"To Antwerp. And you?"</p>

<p>"To France."</p>

<p>He explained that the Carabiniers were
recruits from La Campine, who were being
sent to our lines to finish their training.</p>

<p>"You'll soon get them into shape, won't
you?" said a sailor to the officer. And
shaking his fist at the horizon, he added:</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Lieutenant! We shall
get at the scum some day, never fear."</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> Belgian officer who describes the scene,
M. Edouard de Kayser,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> had left Antwerp
during the night. He did not know that the
defence was at its last gasp, and that the
evacuation had begun. Our sailors were no
better informed. Rear-Admiral Ronarc'h, who
was in command, thought that he was taking
his brigade to Dunkirk; he had been given
a week to form it and organise it on the footing
of two regiments (six battalions and a machine-gun
company). Everything had to be evolved:
the complement of officers, the men, the
auxiliary services. This arduous task was
complicated by the lack of cohesion among
the elements of the brigade and perpetual
changes of quarters (Creil, Stains, Pierrefitte,
etc.). But the idea of forming infantry
brigades with sailors was an after-thought.
Article 11 of the Law of August 8, 1913,
certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> permitted any surplus men in the
navy to be used for service in the field, but
the manner in which these contingents were
to be employed had never been clearly defined.
Would they be linked to existing bodies, or
would they be formed into separate units?
The latter alternative, by far the most
reasonable, which effected a gradual transition,
and, while connecting the naval combatant
with the land forces, preserved his somewhat
jealous but very stimulating <i>esprit de corps</i>,
was by no means unanimously approved.
The Minister overruled objections, and he
was well advised. The glorious lessons of
1870, of Le Bourget and Le Mans, had taught
him what to expect from the co-operation of
navy and army. Some preparation was of
course necessary. Strictly speaking, a navy
is made to navigate, and this explains a certain
neglect of drill; these men in new clothes,
"<i>capelés</i>" (cloaked), as they say, in the new
fashion, their caps bereft of pompons,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> their
collarless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> tunics buttoned up to the throat, had
be transformed into soldiers. Handy as sailors
proverbially are, a certain stiffness of movement
in the early days betrayed the inexperience
of these sea-birds, whose wings
had been clipped; they were further hampered
by heavy infantry overcoats. The
brigade was sent almost immediately to the
entrenched camp of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Scarcely had it
settled into its quarters when its commander
received orders to be ready to start for Dunkirk,
where a new army was being formed.
Dunkirk was not yet threatened; the brigade
would be able to complete its organisation
there. The order was dated October 4.
On the morning of the 7th the brigade entrained
at Saint Denis and at Villetaneuse
with its convoys.</p>

</div>

<p>"We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
are comfortably installed in cattle-trucks,"
notes Fusilier R. in his pocket-book.
"At Creil we see houses that were burnt
by the Germans. Night comes; we try to
sleep, but in vain. It is very cold. We shiver
in our trucks." But over the dunes, along
which the train had been running since it
left Boulogne, a patch of purple light appeared;
then other fires twinkled, green and
red, and the keen breath of the open sea
made itself felt&mdash;Dunkirk. Here a surprise
awaited the brigade: a change in the orders;
it was not to turn out, but the trains were to
go on "towards Belgium, towards the enemy,"
to Antwerp, in short.</p>

<p>The men stamped with joy. They hung
over the doors of the trucks, waving their
caps in greeting to Belgian territory.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
Admiral went off in the first train with his
staff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> On the afternoon of the 8th he found
General Pau on the platform at Ghent. The
great organiser of the connections between
the Allied Armies had just left Antwerp, where
he had been to plan out the retreat of the
Belgian army with King Albert. He informed
the Admiral that the railway had been
cut above the town, and that the six divisions
which were defending Antwerp had begun to
fall back upon Bruges; two divisions were
echeloned to the west of the Terneusen Canal,
and three to the east. Only one division was
still in Antwerp, with 10,000 English troops.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The Belgian cavalry was covering the retreat
on the Scheldt, to the south of Lokeren.
There was no longer any question of entering
Antwerp; the contingent was to co-operate
in the retreating movement with the English
reinforcements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> which were expected, and with
the troops of the garrison at Ghent; everything
seemed to indicate that the enemy would
try to gain ground in the west, and to invest
the Belgian army, exhausted by two months
of incessant fighting, and the forces from
Antwerp that were supporting it at intervals
along the Dutch frontier. But, to ensure the
success of this enveloping man&oelig;uvre, the
Germans would first be obliged to take Ghent
and Bruges, which they might so easily have
done a month earlier; they had deliberately
neglected this precaution, feeling confident
that they would be able to occupy them at
their own time without firing a shot.</p>

<p>By the end of August, indeed, General von
Boehn's Army Corps had advanced to Melle,
within a few miles of Ghent. Although no
resistance had been offered, Melle had been
partially burnt and pillaged; the Germans had
spared only the distillery where their troops
were quartered, which belonged to a naturalised
Bavarian. To save the town from effective
occupation by the enemy, the Burgomaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
M. Braun, had agreed with General von Boehn
to undertake the victualling of the German
troops stationed at Beleghem. The requisition
was not a very harsh one for war time. But
the foes were to meet again; on August 25,
the morrow of Charleroi, the Kaiser would
have cashiered a general as duly convicted of
imbecility who had ventured to suggest that
in October France, supposing her to be still
alive, would have had strength enough in her
death-throes to detach units and send them
to the help of Belgium. Be this as it may, it
is certain that the Belgian army owed its
salvation to this erroneous calculation, or
foolish presumption.</p>

<p>The effort the enemy had scorned to make
in August against Ghent and West Flanders
was now determined upon in October, after
the fall of Antwerp. The conditions seemed
to have changed but little. Ghent, an open
town, spread over an alluvial plain at the
confluence of the Scheldt and the Lys, which
branch off here into innumerable canals, is
open on every side to sudden assault. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
neither forts nor ramparts. We could only
rely upon improvised defences to check the
advance of the enemy. The garrison, under
the command of General Clothen, was reduced
to eight squadrons of cavalry, a mixed
brigade, a volunteer brigade, and two line
regiments, none of them up to full strength.
However, with our 6,000 rifles, they would
suffice to deploy in the loop of the Scheldt,
and on the space between the Scheldt and
the Lys to the south of the town, which seemed
to be specially threatened. If the English
7th Division arrived in time on the following
day, it would reinforce the front, which it
would be unnecessary to extend further for
the purposes of a purely temporary defence,
designed to give the army in Antwerp an
additional day or two. The fighting would
probably be very severe; neither General
Pau, who was responsible for the plan, nor
Admiral Ronarc'h, who was to direct the
principal effort, had any illusions on this
score.</p>

<p>"Salute these gentlemen," said the General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to his Staff, pointing to the naval officers;
"you will not see them again."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The rest of the brigade followed hard upon
the Admiral. The last trains arrived at
Ghent during the night. The whole population
was astir, cheering the sailors as they
marched through the town to their respective
barracks: the Léopold Barracks, the Circus,
and the Théâtre Flamand. The officers and
the Admiral were lodged at the Hôtel des
Postes.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The reveillé was sounded at 4.30 a.m.
The men drank their coffee and set off for
Melle, where the Belgians had prepared
trenches for them.</p>

<h2>II. THE BATTLE OF MELLE</h2>


<p>The little lace-making town, the
younger sister of Mechlin and
Bruges, had not suffered as much
as we had feared. The rattle of the bobbins
was no longer to be heard on the doorsteps;
certain houses showed the stigmata of preliminary
martyrdom in their empty window-frames
and blackened façades. But her heart
beat still, and around her, in the great open conservatory
which forms the outskirts of Ghent,
Autumn had gathered all her floral splendours.
"We marched through fields of magnificent
begonias, among which we are perhaps about
to die," wrote Fusilier R. To die among
flowers like a young girl seems a strange
destiny for the conventional sailor&mdash;the typical
sea-dog with a face tanned by sun and spray.
But the majority of the recruits of the brigade
bore little resemblance to the type. Their
clear eyes looked out of faces but slightly
sunburnt; the famous "Marie-Louises" were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
hardly younger.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Their swaying walk and
a touch of femininity and coquetry in the
precocious development of their muscular
vigour explain the nickname given them by
the heavy Teutons, to whom they were as
disconcerting as an apparition of boyish
Walkyries: <i>the young ladies with the red
pompons</i>! The Admiral, who had just reconnoitred
the position, was conferring with his
lieutenants on the spot; a fraction of the
2nd Regiment, under Commander Varney,
was to take up a position between Gontrode
and Quatrecht, leaving a battalion in reserve
to the north of Melle; a fraction of the
1st Regiment, under Commander Delage,
was to advance between Heusden and Goudenhaut,
and to leave a battalion in reserve at
Destelbergen. He himself would keep with
him as general reserve, at the cross-roads of
Schelde, which was to be his post of command,
the rest of the brigade, that is to say, two
battalions and the machine-gun company.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> convoys, with the exception of the
ambulances commanded by Staff-Surgeon
Seguin, were to stay in the rear, at the gates
of Ghent. This was an indispensable precaution
in view of a rapid retreat, which, however,
the Admiral had no intention of carrying out
until he had sufficiently broken the shock of
the enemy's onslaught.</p>

<p>Thanks to our reinforcements, the Belgian
troops were able to extend their front as much
as was necessary by occupying Lemberge and
Schellerode. The artillery of the 4th mixed
Brigade, emplaced near Lendenhock, commanded
the approaches of the plain. No
trace of the enemy was to be seen. But the
Belgian cyclist scouts had brought in word
that the German vanguard had crossed the
Dendre. We had only just time to occupy our
trenches; in the last resort, if it should be
necessary to fall back on Melle, we should find
a ready-made epaulement in the railway
embankment near the station bridge.</p>

<p>Antwerp was burning, and the civic
authorities were parleying over its surrender;
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> English forces and the last Belgian division
had fortunately been able to leave the town
during the night; they blew up the bridges
behind them, and made for Saint Nicolas
by forced marches, arriving there at dawn.
They hoped to reach Eeclo by evening. But
the enemy was hard in pursuit; a party of
German cavalry was sighted at Zele and
near Wetteren, where they crossed the Scheldt
on a bridge of boats. At the village of
Basteloere they fell in with the Belgian outposts,
whose artillery stopped them for the
time; other forces, further to the north,
advanced in the district of Waïs as far as
Loochristi, 10 kilometres from Ghent. Part
of these came from Alost, the rest from
Antwerp itself; but the bulk of the German
troops remained at Antwerp, to our great
satisfaction.</p>

<p>An enemy less arrogant or less bent on
theatrical effect would undoubtedly have
thrown his whole available forces on the
rear of the retreat; the Germans preferred
to make a sensational entry into
Antwerp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> with fifes sounding and ensigns
spread.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Simultaneously, the troops they had detached
at Alost had their first encounter with
the 2nd Regiment of the Brigade. They were
expected, and a few well-directed volleys
sufficed to check their ardour. To quote one
of our Fusiliers, "they fell like ninepins" at
each discharge. "There was plenty of
whistling round our heads, too," writes another
of the combatants, who expresses his regret
at having been unable "to grease his bayonet
in the bellies of the Germans." He had his
chance later. The enemy returned in force,
and Commander Varney thought it advisable
to call up his reserve, which was at once
replaced at Melle by a battalion of the general
reserve. "There was," says Dr. Caradec, "a
certain gun which was run up by the Germans
about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> 800 metres from the trenches; it had
only just fired its fourth shot when we blew
up its team and its gunners. They were not
able to get it away till nightfall." Indeed,
generally speaking, the enemy's fire, which
was too long in range, did very little
damage to us in the course of this battle;
the town did not suffer appreciably, and only
three shells struck the church. Towards six
o'clock the attack ceased. Night was falling;
a slight mist floated over the fields, and the
enemy took advantage of it to solidify his
position. Pretending to retire, he remained
close at hand, occupying the woods, the
houses, the hedges, the farmyards, and every
obstacle on the ground. These were unequivocal
signs of a speedy resumption of the
offensive. Commander Varney, whose contingents
bore the brunt of the pressure, was
not deceived and kept a sharp look-out. The
men were forbidden to stir; they were told
that they must eat when they could. Besides,
they had nothing for a meal. "It was not
until midnight," says Fusilier R., "that I was
able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> to get a little bread; I offered some of
it to my Commander, who accepted it thankfully."
The mist lifted, but it was still
very dark. Black night on every hand, save
down by Quatrecht, where two torches were
blazing, two farms that had been fired. The
men listened, straining their ears. It was
just a watch, on land instead of at sea. But
nothing stirred till 9 o'clock. Then suddenly
the veil was rent: shells with luminous fuses
burst a few yards from the trenches; the
enemy had received artillery reinforcements;
our position was soon to become untenable.
"We saw the Boches by the light of the shells,
creeping along the hedges and houses like
rats. We fired into the mass, and brought
them down in heaps, but they kept on advancing.
The Commander was unwilling for
us to expose ourselves further; he gave orders
to abandon Gontrode and fall back a little
further upon Melle, behind the railway bank."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>We lost a few men in the retreat. But
our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> position was excellent. About 60 metres
from the trenches our machine-guns poured
out hell-fire on the enemy, whom we had
allowed to approach. A splendid charge by
the Fusiliers completed his discomfiture. It
was four in the morning. At 7 a.m. our patrols
brought us word that Gontrode and Quatrecht
were evacuated; the Germans had not even
stopped to pick up their wounded.</p>

<p>The Fusiliers did this good office for them
when they went to reoccupy Gontrode, taking
the opportunity to collect a good number of
German helmets.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Meanwhile the brigade had
passed under the command of General Capper,
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> the 7th English Division, who had just
arrived at Ghent, where his men received an
ovation like that bestowed on our own sailors.
Indeed, there is a strong likeness between
them. The Englishmen in their dark dun-coloured
uniform, with their clear eyes and
rhythmic gait, are also of an ocean race, and
do not forget it. They swung along, their
rifles under their arms, or held by the barrel
against their shoulders like oars, singing the
popular air adopted by the whole British
army:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>It's a long, long way to Tipperary.</i>
</div>

<p>Apparently Ghent lies on the road to this
goal, for the <i>Tommies</i> can never have been
gayer. These fine troops, which advanced to
the firing line as if they had been going to a
Thames regatta, were the admiration not only
of the citizens of Ghent, but of our own sailors,
who felt an unexpected tenderness for them.
Had not the hereditary foe become our
staunchest ally? "We look upon them as
brothers," wrote a sailor of the Passage
Lauriec to his family next day.</p>

<p>Reinforced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> by two of their battalions and
the Belgian troops of the sector, we were
ordered to hold our former positions in the
loop of the Scheldt. But towards noon, after
a visit from a Taube, the enemy developed
such a fierce attack upon Gontrode and
Quatrecht that at the end of the day we had
to repeat the man&oelig;uvre of the preceding day
and fall back upon the railway bank. Here
at least the German offensive spent itself in
vain upon the glacis of this natural redoubt,
defended with conspicuous gallantry by Commander
Varney's three battalions. The rest
of the night was quiet; the reliefs came into
the trenches normally at dawn, and those who
wished were free to go to church. It was a
Sunday. "I have been to mass in a very
pretty little church," wrote Seaman F., of the
Isle of Sein. The day passed very well.
In the evening after supper we went to bed.
Scarcely had we lain down upon the straw
when the order was given to turn out again.</p>

<p>We were to beat a retreat, and it was time.
The apparent inactivity of the enemy during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
this day of the 11th of October was explained
by his desire to turn our position and surround
us with all his forces in the loop of the Scheldt.
On both banks of the river, down-stream and
to the south, long grey lines were writhing. It
was a question whether it would be wise to
expose ourselves further, and to give the
enemy a pretext for bombarding Ghent, an
open town, which we had decided not to
defend. Had we not achieved our main
object, since our resistance of the previous days
had given the Belgian army forty-eight hours'
start? Headquarters acknowledged that we
had carried out our mission unfalteringly.
From the moment when they first came into
touch with the enemy the Naval Fusiliers
had behaved with the firmness and endurance
of tried troops, like "old growlers," as
Fusilier R. said. Twice the German infantry
had given way to their irresistible charge.
This gave good hope for the future.</p>

<p>Our own casualties had been inconsiderable.
Ten of our men had been killed, among them
Naval Lieutenant Le Douget, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in the trenches, with his company, and who
had been mortally wounded by a bullet as he
was falling back on the railway embankment;
we had 39 wounded and one missing, whereas,
according to the official <i>communiqué</i>, the
enemy's losses were 200 killed and 50 prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Melle was not a great battle, but it was a
victory, "our first victory," said the men
proudly, the first canto of their Iliad. And
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> troops which gained this victory were
under fire for the first time. They came from
the five ports, mainly from Brittany, which
provides four-fifths of the combatants for
naval warfare. And the majority of them,
setting aside a few warrant-officers, were
young apprentices taken from the dépôts
before they had finished their training, but
well stiffened by non-commissioned officers
of the active list and the reserve. The
officers themselves, with the exception of the
commanders of the two regiments (Captains
Delage and Varney), who ranked as colonels,
and the battalion commanders (Captains
Rabot, Marcotte de Sainte-Marie, and De
Kerros, 1st Regiment; Jeanniot, Pugliesi-Conti,
and Mauros, 2nd Regiment), belonged
for the most part to the Naval Reserve. It
was, in fact, a singular army, composed almost
entirely of recruits and veterans, callow youths
and greybeards. There were even some novices
of the Society of Jesus, Father de Blic and
Father Poisson,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> serving as sub-lieutenants,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> a former Radical deputy, Dr. Plouzané,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
who acted as surgeon. The percentage of
casualties was very high among the older
men at the beginning of the campaign, and
this has been made a reproach to them. If
a great many officers fell, it was not due to
bravado, still less to ignorance of the profession
of arms, as has been suggested<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>;
but leaders must preach by example, and
there is only one way of teaching others to
die bravely. We must not forget that their
men were recruits, without homogeneity, without
experience, almost without training. The
<i>moral</i> of troops depends on that of their
chiefs. "If you go about speaking to no
one, sad and pensive," said Monluc, "even
if all your men had the hearts of lions, you
would turn them into sheep." This was
certainly the opinion of the officers of the
brigade, and notably of him who commanded
the 2nd Regiment, Captain Varney, "always
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> the breach," according to an eye-witness,
"going on foot to the first lines and the
outposts and even beyond them, as at Melle.
Here," adds the narrator, "he was on an
armoured car, but ... on the step, entirely
without cover, to give confidence to his men."
One of the officers of his regiment, Lieutenant
Gouin,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> wounded in the foot in the same
encounter, refused to go to the ambulance
until the enemy began to retreat; Second-Lieutenant
Gautier,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> commanding a machine-gun
section, allowed a German attack to
advance to within 60 metres, "to teach the
gunners not to squander their ammunition,"
and when wounded in the head, said: "What
does it matter, since every one of my 502
bullets found its billet?"</p>

<p>Moreover, the chief of these gallant fellows,
Rear-Admiral Ronarc'h, had proved himself a
strategist on other battle-fields; the Minister's
choice was due neither to complaisance nor to
chance.</p>

<p>Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> Ronarc'h is a Breton; his guttural,
sonorous name is almost a birth-certificate.
And physically the man answers exactly to
the image evoked by his name and race. His
short, sturdy, broad-shouldered figure is
crowned by a rugged, resolute head, the
planes strongly marked, but refined, and even
slightly ironical; he has the true Celtic eyes,
slightly veiled, which seem always to be
looking at things afar off or within; morally
he is, as one of his officers says: "a furze-bush
of the cliffs, one of those plants that flourish
in rough winds and poor soil, that strike root
among the crevices of granite rocks and can
never be detached from them: Breton obstinacy
in all its strength, but a calm, reflective
obstinacy, very sober in its outward manifestations,
and concentrating all the resources
of a mind very apt in turning the most unpromising
elements to account upon its
object."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It is rather remarkable that all
the great leaders in this war are taciturn and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>thoughtful men; never has the antithesis of
deeds and words been more strongly marked.
It has been noted elsewhere that Admiral
Ronarc'h, though a very distinguished sailor,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
seems destined to fight mainly as a soldier in
war; as a naval lieutenant and adjutant-major
to Commander de Marolles, he accompanied
the Seymour column sent to the relief
of the European Legations when the Boxers
besieged them in Pekin. The column, which
was too weak, though it was composed of
sailors of the four European naval divisions
stationed in Chinese waters, was obliged to
fall back hurriedly towards the coast. It was
almost a defeat, in the course of which the
detachments of the Allied divisions lost a
great many men and all the artillery they
had landed. The French detachment was
the only one which brought off its guns. The
author of this fine strategic man&oelig;uvre was
rewarded by promotion to the command of a
frigate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> he was then 37 years old. At the
date of his promotion (March 23, 1902) he
was the youngest officer of his rank. At 49,
in spite of his grizzled moustache and "imperial,"
he is the youngest of our admirals.
He attained his present rank in June, 1914,
and was almost immediately called upon to
form the Marine Brigade.</p>

"The Germans had not expected such a resistance, and even
less had they thought to find us in front of them. They
suspected a trap, and this paralysed their offensive, though
our line was so thin that a vigorous onslaught could not
have failed to break it. This they did not dare to make;
several times they advanced to within a few metres of our
trenches and then stopped short. We shot them down at
our ease. Yet our positions were far from solid; we were
on the railway embankment, and the trenches consisted of a
few holes dug between the rails; the bridge had not even
been barricaded by the Belgian engineers, and nothing
would have been simpler than to have passed under it.
When night came, Commander Conti ordered me to see
to it. I turned on a little electric pocket light; the
bullets at once began to whistle about my ears; the
Germans were only about 20 metres from the bridge, but
they made no attempt to pass!"</p></div>

<h2>III. RETREAT</h2>


<p>How was the retirement to be carried
out?</p>

<p>The operation seemed to be a
very delicate one. The enemy was watching
us on every side. General Capper's orders
were to disengage ourselves by a night march
to Aeltre, where the roads to Bruges and
Thielt intersect. The retreat began very
accurately and methodically, facilitated by the
precautionary arrangements the Admiral had
made: first, our convoys; then, half an hour
later, our troops, which were replaced temporarily
in their positions by the English
units. "As we passed through Ghent," writes
Fusilier B., "we were heartily cheered
again, the more so as some of us had taken
Prussian helmets, which they showed to the
crowd. The enthusiasm was indescribable.
The ladies especially welcomed us warmly."
Fair Belgium had given us her heart; she did
not withdraw it, even when we seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
forsaking her. Covered by the English division
which followed us after the space of two
hours, we passed through Tronchiennes, Luchteren,
Meerendré, Hansbeke, and Bellem, a
long stretch of eight leagues, by icy moonlight,
with halts of ten minutes at each stage. The
motor-cars of the brigade rolled along empty,
all the officers, even the oldest of them,
electing to march with their men. Aeltre was
not reached till dawn. The brigade had not
been molested in its retreat; we lost nothing
on the way, neither a straggler nor a cartridge.
And all our dead, piously buried the night
before by the chaplain of the 2nd Regiment,
the Abbé Le Helloco, with the help of the curé
and the Burgomaster, were sleeping in the
little churchyard of Melle.</p>

<p>After snatching a hasty meal and resting
their legs for a while, the men started for
Thielt. "Twenty-five kilometres on top of
the forty we had done in the night," says a
Fusilier, somewhat hyperbolically. "And
they say sailors are not good walkers!"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> avoid corns, they marched bare-footed,
their boots slung over their shoulders. And
they had to drag the machine-guns, for which
there were no teams. But Aeltre, the kindness
of its inhabitants, the good coffee served
out, and laced by a generous municipal
ration of rum, had revived them. "What
good creatures they are!" said a Fusilier.
"They receive us as if we were their own
children!"</p>

<p>The brigade reached Thielt between four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and five in the afternoon; the English division
arrived at six, and we at once went into our
temporary quarters; the roads were barricaded,
and strong guards were placed at
every issue. Fifty thousand Germans were
galloping in pursuit of us. If they did not
catch us at Thielt, we perhaps owed this to
the Burgomaster of one of the places we had
passed through, who sent them on a wrong
track. His heroic falsehood cost him his life,
and secured a good night's rest for our men.
For the first time for three days they were
able to sleep their fill on the straw of hospitable
Belgian farms and make up for the fatigues
of their previous vigils. A Taube paid an
unwelcome visit in the morning, but was
received with a vigorous fusillade, and the
"beastly bird" was brought down almost
immediately, falling in the English lines, to
the great delight of our men. Shortly afterwards
we broke up our camp and set out for
Thourout, which we reached at 1 p.m. Here
the English division had to leave us, to march
upon Roulers, and the brigade came under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the command of King Albert, whose outposts
we had now reached.</p>

<p>The Belgian army, after its admirable
retreat from Antwerp, had merely touched at
Bruges, and deciding not to defend Ostend,
had fallen back by short marches towards the
Yser. All its convoys had not yet arrived.
To ensure their safety, it had decided, in
spite of its exhausted state, to deploy in an
undulating line extending from Menin to the
marshes of Ghistelles; the portion of this
front assigned to the Fusiliers ran from the
wood of Vijnendaele to the railway station
of Cortemarck. On the 14th, in a downpour
of rain, the brigade marched to the west of
Pereboom, and took up a position facing
east. It was the best position open to them,
though, indeed, it was poor enough, by reason
of its excentricity. The enemy, who had
finally got on our track, was reported to be
advancing in dense masses upon Cortemarck.
The 6,000 men of the brigade, however heroic
they might prove themselves, could not hope
to offer a very long resistance to such overwhelming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
forces on a position so difficult to
maintain, a position without natural defences,
without cover on any side, even towards the
west, where the French troops had not yet
completed their extension. It was the Admiral's
duty to report to the Belgian Headquarters
Staff on these tactical defects; the
reply was an order to make a stand "at all
costs," a term fully applicable to the situation;
but this was rescinded, and at midnight on
October 15 the retreat was resumed.</p>

<p>It ceased only on the banks of the Yser.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> This was one of the first questions General Pau put to
the Admiral: "Are your men good walkers?" He foresaw
that they might have to execute a very rapid retreat.
Our officers felt some anxiety on this score. "When not
in danger," says Dr. L. F. in his note-book, "the sailor
gets rusty. At the beginning of October all of us, officers
and men alike, had received the blue infantry overcoat,
which was obligatory. The men shouldered knapsacks
(not without grumbling), and we were transformed into
troopers, nothing left of naval uniform but our caps....
This part of the foot-soldier assigned to them seems an
inferior one to our men, and they accept it unwillingly,
especially when it entails military marches with great-coats
and haversacks. We had innumerable limpers and laggards
on our marches in the environs of Paris. The contrast
was very striking to those who saw our men afterwards in
Belgium. It was a proof of the marvellous resilience of
our race, and more particularly of our Bretons, who are
always in the majority in the brigade."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<h2>IV. ON THE YSER</h2>


<p>Our columns started at 4 a.m., while
it was still quite dark, but the roads
were good in spite of the rain which
had been falling incessantly all night.</p>

<p>The route was through Warken, Zarren, and
Eessen, with Dixmude as its final point. The
first battalion of the 2nd Regiment and the
three Belgian batteries of the Pontus group
brought up the rear. The advance was
hampered by the usual congestion of the
roads, refugees fleeing before the invaders,
dragging bundles containing all their worldly
goods. These miserable beings seemed to be
moving along mechanically, their legs the
only part of them that showed any vitality.
They halted by the roadside, making way for
us, staring at us dully, as if they had left their
souls behind them with all the dear familiar
things of their past lives. Our men called
out to them as they passed: "Keep your
hearts up. We'll come back."</p>

<p>They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> made no answer. It was still raining,
and the water was streaming off the great-coats.
Near Eessen we left Commander de
Kerros with the second battalion of the 1st
Regiment, to hold the roads of Vladsloo,
Clercken, and Roulers; the third battalion of
the 2nd Regiment, under Commander Mauros,
pushed on in the direction of Woumen, to
bar the way to Ypres. We had a fine front,
though the Admiral thought it rather too
wide for our strength. The four other
battalions and the machine-gun company
entered Dixmude about noon, and at once
took up a position behind the Yser after
detaching a strong outpost guard on the
north, near the village of Beerst, on the
Ostend road, by the side of which runs a
little light railway for local transport. The
Admiral, who had been anxiously looking out
for some undulation in this desperately flat
landscape where he could place his artillery,
found a suitable spot at last to the south of
the Chapel of Notre Dame de Bon Secours,
half-way to Eessen. He chose the chapel itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>for his own headquarters. All these arrangements
were made immediately, and the men
had scarcely got into their quarters, when
they were sent out with spades and picks,
together with a company of the Belgian
Engineers, to put the outskirts of the town
into a state of defence. They had to be
content with measures of the greatest urgency
alone, for the enemy was pressing in upon us
and creeping up to Dixmude. A few shrapnel
shells had already fallen upon the town, the
inhabitants of which began to decamp hastily.
However, the railway was still intact, and we
were expecting the last trains of material
from Antwerp. "At all costs"&mdash;this is
a phrase that recurs very often in orders
from the Staff, and one which the brigade
accepted unmurmuringly&mdash;the line was to be
protected and the enemy held. Two, three,
trains passed, and strange ones they were.
They continued to run in until night; the
fires were covered up; the engine-drivers
never whistled; all that was heard was
the muffled pant of the engine, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
great sigh rising from the devastated
plains.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

(From a picture by M. Léon Cassel)" title="" />
<span class="caption">LA GRAND&#39; PLACE, DIXMUDE<br />
(From a picture by M. Léon Cassel)</span>
</div>

<p>That same evening our outposts on the
Eessen road were attacked by an armoured car
and 200 German cyclists; they repulsed the
attack; but we were really too much exposed
in our position. The Admiral decided that
it was imprudent to maintain such a wide
front with troops numerically so weak, but
which it would take a long time to move off.
At Dixmude, on the other hand, where the
Yser begins to curve towards the coast, and
forms a re-entrant confronting the enemy, there
was a position which would permit of a concentric
fire from our artillery, particularly
favourable to the defensive attitude we were
to assume. The considerations which had
forced us to extend our front had no longer
any weight; all the transports from Antwerp
had got in in time. The safety of the Belgian
army was assured; its material had reached
it, and, with the exception of certain units
which had been made prisoners in the
evacuation of Antwerp or had been driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
into Holland, and the divisions which continued
our line to the North Sea, it was in
shelter behind the Yser, in touch with the
English corps and the army of General d'Urbal.
The brigade might therefore very properly
concentrate its defensive round Dixmude.</p>

<p>The Belgian command, which had passed
into the hands of General Michel, readily
accepted these arguments, and the operation
was agreed upon for the next day. "The
Boches were there twenty-four hours after us,"
says a sailor's letter. "We hoped they were
eight kilometres from the town. We were all
dead tired, but standing firm." The evacuation
of these dangerous outposts on flat, open
ground, where scattered farms, occasional
stacks of straw, and the poplars along the
roadside were the only available cover, was
carried out with very trifling loss, and we at
once organised our defences round Dixmude.</p>

<p>"The Admiral has cast anchor here," wrote
a warrant officer of Servel on October 18. "I
don't expect we shall weigh it again just yet."</p>

<p>The image was very appropriate. Dixmude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
especially when its eastern outskirts were
under water, was not unlike a ship anchored
fore and aft at the entrance of an inland sea.
But this ship had neither armour plates,
quarter-netting, nor portholes. The trenches
that had been hastily dug round the town
could not have been held against a strong
infantry attack; the first rush would have
carried them. A whole system of defence had
to be organised, and all had to be done in a
few hours, actually under the enemy's fire.
All honour to the Admiral for having attempted
it, and for holding on to Dixmude as he would
have done to his own ship! No sooner had
he recognised the importance of the position
than he set to work to increase its defensive
value; he was not to be seduced by the
feints of the enemy and the temptations
offered to beguile him into deploying. Crouching
upon the Yser, his head towards the enemy,
he only left his lines three times: to support a
French cavalry attack upon Thourout, to
draw back the enemy, who was concentrating
in another direction, and was diverted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
fears for Woumen, and finally to co-operate in
the recapture of Pervyse and Ramscappelle.
But meanwhile, even when he thus detached
units and sent them some distance from their
base, he kept the whole or a part of his
reserves at Dixmude; he clung to his re-entrant&mdash;he
kept his watch on the Yser.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<h2>V. DIXMUDE</h2>


<p>On October 16, 1914, Dixmude (in
Flemish Diksmuiden) numbered
about 4,000 inhabitants. The
<i>Guides</i> call it "a pretty little town," but it
was scarcely more than a large village. "It
is a kind of Pont-Labbé," wrote one of our
sailors, but a Flemish Pont-Labbé, all bricks
and tiles, dotted with cafés and nunneries,
clean, mystical, sensuous, and charming, especially
when the rain ceased for a while,
and the old houses, coloured bright green or
yellow, smiled at the waters of the canal
behind their screen of ancient limes, under a
clear sky. From the four points of the
horizon long lines of poplars advanced in
procession to the fine church of Saint Nicolas,
the pride of the place. The graceful fifteenth-century
apse was justly praised; but after
having admired this, there were further
beauties to enjoy in the interior, which contained
a good Jouvenet, Jordaens' <i>Adoration
of the Magi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> a well-proportioned font, and one
of the most magnificent rood-screens of West
Flanders, the contemporary and rival of those
of Folgoët and Saint-Etienne-du-Mont.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;">

(From a picture by M. Léon Cassel)" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE PAPEGAEI INN<br />
(From a picture by M. Léon Cassel)</span>
</div>

<p>This stately church, the exquisite Grand'
Place of the Hôtel de Ville, the "Roman"
bridge of the canal of Handzaeme, the
slender silhouette of the Residencia (the house
of the Spanish Governors), and five or six
other old-time dwellings, with crow-stepped or
flexured gables, like the hostelry of <i>Den
Papegaei</i> (The Parrot), which bore the date of
its foundations in huge figures upon its bulging
front, hardly sufficed to draw the cosmopolitan
tourist tide towards Dixmude. Travellers
neglected it; historians ignored it. The
capital of an essentially agricultural district,
at the confluence of two industries, and astride,
so to speak, upon the infinity of beetroot-fields
and the infinity of meadows to which
the Yser serves as the line of demarcation,
Dixmude showed a certain animation only on
market-days; then it appeared as the metropolis
of the vast flat district, streaked with
canals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> and more aquatic than terrestrial,
where innumerable flocks and herds pastured
under the care of classic shepherds in loose
grey coats. The salt marsh-mutton of Dixmude
and its butter, which was exported
even to England, were famous. A peaceful
population, somewhat slow and stolid, ruddy
of complexion, husky and deliberate of speech,
led lives made up of hard work, religious
observance, and sturdy drinking bouts in the
scattered farms about the town. The Flemish
plains do not breed dreamers. When, like
those of Dixmude, such plains are amphibious,
half land, half water, they do not, as a rule,
stimulate the fighting instinct; their inhabitants
are absorbed in domestic cares,
battling unceasingly for a livelihood with two
rival elements.</p>

<p>Such were the only battles that they knew;
no invader had ever ventured among them.
Invasion, indeed, seemed physically impossible.
The whole country between the
hills of Cassel, Dixmude, and the line of
sand-hills along the coast is but a vast <i>schoore</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a huge polder snatched from the sea, and
almost entirely below the sea-level, owing to
the deposits of mud left high and dry on the
shore. Down to the eleventh century it was
still a bay into which the <i>drakkars</i> of the
Norse pirates might venture. If Dixmude,
like Penmarc'h and Pont-Labbé, had retained
its maritime character, we might have found
on the fronts of its riverside houses the rusty
iron rings to which barques were once moored.
To safeguard the tenure of this uncertain soil,
slowly annexed by centuries of effort, conquered,
but not subdued, and always ready to
revert to its former state, it was not enough
to thrust back the sea, which would have overflowed
it twice a day at high tide; it was
further necessary to drain off the fresh water,
which streams down into it from the west and
the south, mainly from the stiff clay of the
Dutch hills, floods the meadows, cuts through
the roads, and invades the villages. The
struggle is unintermittent. Such country,
threatened on every side, is only habitable by
virtue of incessant precautions and watchfulness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
The sea is kept under control by
Nieuport, with its formidable array of sluices,
locks, chambers, water-gates, and cranks; the
fresh water, which oozes out on every hand,
spangling the rough homespun of the glebe
with diamond pools from the beginning of
autumn to long after the end of winter, is
dealt with by a methodical and untiring
system of drainage directed, under State control,
by associations of farmers and landowners
(<i>gardes wateringues</i>). Hence the innumerable
cuttings (<i>watergands</i>) along the hedges, the
thousands of drains that chequer the soil,
the dykes, several metres high, which overhang
the rivers&mdash;the Yser, the Yperlee, the Kemmelbeck,
the Berteartaart, the Vliet, and twenty
other unnamed streams of inoffensive aspect&mdash;which,
when swelled by the autumn rains,
become foaming torrents rushing out upon
the ancient <i>schoore</i> of Dixmude. The roads
have to be raised very high in this boundless
marsh land, the depressed surface of which is
broken only by sparse groups of trees and the
roofs of low-lying farms. They are few in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
number, only just sufficient to ensure communication,
and they require constant repair.
Torn up by shells and mined by the huge
German explosives, the "saucepans" (<i>marmites</i>)
and "big niggers" (<i>gros noirs</i>), as the
sailors call them, our company of French and
Belgian road-menders had to work day and
night throughout the operations to keep them
open.</p>

<p>Other roads that meander across the plain
are negligible. They are mere tracks, most
of which are obliterated when the subterranean
waters rise in the autumn. For in
these regions the water is everywhere: in
the air, on the earth, and under the earth,
where it appears barely a metre beneath the
surface as soon as the crust of soft clay that
it raises in blisters is lifted. It rains three
days out of four here. Even the north
winds, which behead the meagre trees and
lay them over in panic-stricken attitudes, bring
with them heavy clouds of cold rain gathered
in hyborean zones. And when the rain
ceases, the mists rise from the ground, white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
mists, almost solid, in which men and things
take on a ghostly aspect. Sometimes indeed
the <i>schoore</i> lights up between two showers, like
a tearful face trying to smile, but such good
moments are rare. This is the country of
moisture, the kingdom of the waters, of
fresh water, that bugbear of sailors. And it
was here that fate called upon them to fight,
to make their tremendous effort. For nearly
four weeks, from October 16 to November 10
(the date of the taking of Dixmude), they,
with their Admiral, clung desperately to their
raft of suffering at the entrance to the delta
of marshes, watched over by ancient windmills
with shattered wings. One against six, without
socks and drawers, under incessant rain,
and in mud more cruel than the enemy's
shells, they accomplished their task, barring
the road to Dunkirk, first ensuring the safety
of the Belgian army and then enabling our
own Armies of the North to concentrate
behind the Yser and dissipate the shock of
the enemy's attack. "At the beginning of
October," says the <i>Bulletin des Armées</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>November 25, 1914, which sums up the
situation very exactly, "the Belgian army
quitted Antwerp too much exhausted to take
part in any movement.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The English were
leaving the Aisne for the north; General
Castelnau's army had not advanced beyond
the south of Arras, and that of General
Maudhuy was defending itself from the south
of Arras to the south of Lille. Further off
we had cavalry, Territorials, and Naval
Fusiliers." For the moment at Dixmude,
the most exposed point of all, we had only
the Fusiliers and a few Belgian detachments,
who were putting forth their remaining
strength in a supreme effort to co-operate in
the defence.</p>

</div>

<p>The Admiral had said to them: "The task
given to you is a solemn and a dangerous one.
All your courage is needed. Sacrifice yourselves
to save our left wing until reinforcements
can come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> up. Try to hold out for
at least <i>four days</i>."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight the reinforcements
had not yet arrived, and the Fusiliers were
still "holding out." These men had no
illusions as to the fate awaiting them. They
knew they were doomed, but they understood
the grandeur of their sacrifice. "The post of
honour was given to us sailors," wrote
Fusilier P., of Audierne, on November 5;
"we were to hold that corner at all costs
and to die rather than surrender. And indeed
we did stand firm, although we were only a
handful of men against a force six times as
large as ours, with artillery." They numbered
exactly 6,000 sailors and 5,000 Belgians, under
the command of Colonel (acting General)
Meiser, against three German army corps.
Their artillery was very insufficient, at least
at the beginning. They had no heavy guns
and no air-planes,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> nothing to give them information
but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> the reports of the Belgian
cyclists and the approximate estimates of
the men in the trenches.</p>

<p>"How many of you were there?" asked a
Prussian major who had been taken prisoner,
speaking the day after the fall of Dixmude.
"Forty thousand, at least!"</p>

<p>And when he heard that there had been
only 6,000 sailors, he wept with rage, muttering:</p>

<p>"Ah! if we had only known!"</p>

<h2>VI. THE CAPTURE OF BEERST</h2>


<p>Save for an unimportant suburb beyond
the Handzaeme Canal, Dixmude lies
entirely on the right bank of the Yser.
Nevertheless, our general line of defence on
October 16, both up and down stream, went
beyond the line traced by the course of the
river. From Saint-Jacques-Cappelle to the
North Sea, by way of Beerst, Keyem, Leke,
Saint-Pierre, etc., little rural settlements but
yesterday unknown, drowsing in the gentle
Flemish calm, the arc of the circle it described
followed, almost throughout its course as
far as Slype, the roadside light railway from
Ypres to Ostend. The Fusiliers flanked this
front from Saint-Jacques to the confluence of
the Vliet. The 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th Belgian
Divisions occupied the rest of the horse-shoe,
but the effectives of these reduced divisions
had not been made up; some of the regiments
had been reduced from 6,000 to 2,000 men;
whole companies had melted away. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
remnants continued to stand their ground with
fine courage. Until when? They had been
asked, like our Fusiliers, to hold out for four
days, and it was not until October 23, at
the end of nine days, that General Grossetti
and his reinforcements arrived.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The Admiral had divided the defence of
Dixmude into two sectors, cut by the road of
Caeskerke; the north sector was entrusted to
the 1st Regiment, under Commander Delage,
the south to the 2nd Regiment, under Commander
Varney. His Command Post he established
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> Caeskerke station, at the junction
of the lines of Furnes and Nieuport, keeping
only a battalion of the 2nd Regiment at his
own disposal. Of the two batteries of the
Belgian group, one was sent to the south of
the second level crossing of the Furnes railway,
the other to the north of Caeskerke. A telephone
line connected them with the great
flour factory of Dixmude, at the head of
the High Bridge. A platform of reinforced
cement belonging to this factory provided us
with an excellent observatory. The thickness
of this mass of concrete, as costly as it was
incongruous with the importance of the
establishment, but very well adapted for
heavy guns, which would command the whole
valley of the Yser, did not fail to suggest
certain reflections. This was perhaps one of
the few instances in which ante-bellum preparations
had turned against their authors.
The machine-gun company was stationed at
the intersection of the roads to Pervyse and
Oudecappelle; in the trenches of the Yser
we had mainly Belgian troops; finally, to
the south,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> debouching from the forest of
Houthulst with four divisions of cavalry,
General de Mitry threw out a bold advance
post towards Clercken, and relieved us a little
on that side, although he was unable to control
the German offensive, which began in force
at 4 p.m.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The enemy had begun in his customary
manner by preparing the ground with his
artillery, which from the hollow where it was
posted, near Eessen, to the east of Dixmude,
rained projectiles upon us from 10 and 15-centimetre
guns. Scarcely had the last smoke
clouds of the German batteries lifted, when the
infantry advanced to the attack. The action
was very hot, and was prolonged throughout
the night and the morning of the 17th, with
violent alternations of advance and retreat.
The enemy, anxious to deal a decisive blow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>came on in compact masses, in which our
machine-guns and rifle fire tore bloody
breaches. These mobile bastions wavered for
a few seconds, filled up the breaches, and then
returned to the charge in the same close
formation as before. No network of barbed
wire protected the approach to our trenches;
most of them had neither roofs nor parapets.
In these haphazard defences, successful
resistance depended solely on the intrepidity
of the men and the skill of the commander.
Certain "elements" were taken,
retaken, lost, and retaken again. But as a
whole our line held; the enemy failed to
break through it. At dawn, discouraged, he
suspended his attack, but, like a dog who
makes off growling, he never ceased shelling
us till 11 a.m. "After this," notes Fusilier
B., "all noise ceased. Dixmude has not
suffered much. The damage caused by the
shells is insignificant." True, the enemy had
not yet received his heavy artillery.</p>

<p>We profited by the respite granted us to
repair the trenches of the outskirts, which
were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> somewhat damaged, and begin the
organisation of the others. This work, indeed,
was resumed whenever there was a lull, but
it was carried on chiefly at night, and in the
morning, from 5 to 9 o'clock, until the mists
lifted. At this hour and the coming of light
the German batteries generally awoke. We
had not enough guns to reply efficaciously to
the enemy. The brigade was therefore greatly
rejoiced by the reinforcements it received
during the day of the 17th: five batteries of
the 3rd Regiment of Belgian Artillery (Colonel
de Weeschouwer), which, added to the Pontus
group, gave the defenders of Dixmude the
respectable total of 72 guns. Unhappily
their range was not very great, and the
metal of which they were made was not strong
enough to bear the strain of our .75 shells.
Such as they were, however, our front was in
much better case when they had been distributed
from Caeskerke to Saint-Jacques-Cappelle.
The Admiral, who wished to direct
their operations himself, had these batteries
connected by telephone with his quarters; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
battle is directed from a study-table nowadays.
Nevertheless, he gave a standing
order that the batteries were to open fire
instantly, whether by day or night, on the
approaches to Dixmude, whenever rifle fire
or the sound of machine-guns indicated
that an infantry attack threatened our
trenches.</p>

<p>The check received on October 16 had
perhaps made the enemy more cautious. He
had allowed us breathing time in the afternoon
of the 17th, and he gave us a quiet
day on Sunday, the 18th. Only two or
three cavalry patrols were reported near Dixmude,
and these were rapidly dispersed by
a few salvoes. That day, too, our Fusiliers
had a pleasant surprise. A tall, silent
officer, with serious eyes, in a closely buttoned
black dolman, came to visit the
trenches of the Yser with the Admiral.
His inspection seemed satisfactory to him.
He pressed the Admiral's hand, and when he
had regained the river bank, he paused a
moment, gazing at the triangle of marshes, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that remained to him of his kingdom. It was
Albert I.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Other news from the front arrived, and
gave us confidence. In spite of the fall of
Lille, our Armies of the North had taken the
offensive with marked success from Roye to
the Lys. Orders had come from the English
headquarters to the 1st Corps to concentrate
at Ypres, whence it was to attempt to advance
towards Bruges.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This strategic movement
had even been initiated, and the French
cavalry which had just seized Clercken might
be considered the advance guard of Sir Douglas
Haig's corps. It asked the Admiral to support
it in flank, to enable it to push on to Zarren
and Thourout. He at once sent forward
Commander de Kerros with a battalion of the
1st Regiment and two Belgian armoured cars
towards Eessen.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The road was free; it was
strewn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> with the carcases of dead horses, and
even with dead soldiers, as if there had been
a precipitate retreat. The enemy seemed to
have evaporated. But the church of Eessen,
which he had turned into a stable, just as
afterwards he turned the church of Vladsloo
into a cesspool, with the immemorial Teuton
taste for sacrilege, showed evidences of his
recent passage. These tracks of the beast
did not, however, tell us which way he had
gone. Several roads lay open to him. It
seemed most probable that, hearing of the
movement of the French cavalry, he was
retiring upon Bruges by way of Wercken or
Vladsloo. Taking his chance, Commander de
Kerros had installed himself to await the
morning, while two Turco regiments,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which
had been placed at the Admiral's disposal
and ensured his <i>liaison</i> with the main body
operating on Thourout, set out as foragers
towards Bovekerke and the woods of Couckelaere.
Morning dawned, and the execution of
the French plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> seemed about to be realised
normally, when a terrible thrust by the
enemy at a wholly unexpected point suddenly
upset all calculations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i093.jpg" width="600" height="327" alt="Cl. Meurisse

<span class="caption">Cl. Meurisse<br />

</div>

<p>In reality the Germans had not retreated
at all, or rather they had only retired to
come into touch again under more favourable
conditions. Knowing the sort of reception
that awaited them at Dixmude, they had
decided to try another point on the front, in
the hope that "the little Belgians" would be
easier to deal with than the "young ladies
with red pompons." About 9 o'clock on the
morning of the 19th they threw themselves
in three simultaneous leaps, at Leke, Keyem,
and Beerst, upon the thin Belgian line, which
staggered under the shock. The question was
whether we should be able to reinforce it in
time. If it were broken, the road would
lie open to the Yser, the Yser would perhaps
be seized, and Dixmude taken in the rear.
The Admiral did not hesitate; the whole
brigade should go if necessary. He sent
forward two of his reserve battalions by forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
marches on the road to Ostend, another, under
Commander Mauros, towards Vladsloo and
Hoograde in flank. The artillery supported the
movement, which began at 10 o'clock. But
we did not know whether Keyem and Beerst
were in the hands of the Belgians or of the
Germans, and in this uncertainty we dared
not open fire upon them. The two villages
were wrapped in ominous silence. Commander
Jeanniot and Commander Pugliesi-Conti,
who were marching upon Keyem with
the first and second battalions of the 2nd
Regiment, made their arrangements accordingly.
While the sixth company of the second
battalion advanced towards Keyem, with
Lieutenant Pertus, the fifth company, under
Lieutenant de Maussion de Candé, received
orders to make for Beerst. De Maussion put
his company into line of sections in fours. On
approaching the village he was received by a
salvo of machine-guns. The Germans were
entrenched in the houses and the church,
whence they poured a withering fire upon
our troops. The attack was made peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
difficult by the nature of the ground, which
was completely flat, and afforded no cover
save the irrigation ditches and a few leafless
hedges; the only possible method of advance
was crawling. We lost a good many men in
this deploying man&oelig;uvre, so ill adapted to
the impulsive nature of sailors; every head
that was raised became a target. De Maussion,
who had stood up to inspect the enemy's
position, was struck down. Every moment
one of our men rolled over among the beetroots.
Would the charge never sound? It
would, but not yet. Pertus fell first, his
leg shattered at the moment when he was
carrying a group of farms close to Keyem;
Lieutenant Hébert was sent with the eighth
company to support him. But the ditches
on the road were already occupied by the
men of the first battalion, and Hébert had to
cut across fields to avoid this encumbered
road. The fire directed against us had become
very hot. It took us in flank, and we
ran the risk of being wiped out before we had
reached our objective. The Hébert company
accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> swerved to the right, and marched
to the edge of the woods and the houses
situated between Beerst and Keyem, where
the enemy's artillery and infantry seemed to
be posted.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Hébert took up a position in a farm
with the third section; Second-Lieutenant
de Blois and Boatswain Fossey with the first
and second sections deployed to act as marksmen,
facing the wood. Creeping from hedge
to hedge and from <i>watergand</i> to <i>watergand</i>,
supported by Lieutenant de Roncy's machine-guns,
they arrived to within 500 metres of
the enemy's position in connection with
Commander Jeanniot, who had arrived at the
same point on the left by a similar man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>"I think this is our moment," said the
commander.</p>

<p>"Forward!" cried De Blois to his men.</p>

<p>Fossey gave the same order; the two
sections sprang out of their temporary trenches
under a hail of bullets. Fossey was killed,
De Blois severely wounded in the head and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>leg.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The rest of the sections found their way
to the farm where Hébert was making an
attempt to check the enemy's counter-attack
by fire from the loopholes that had been
stopped up by the former occupants of the
upper storeys, but which he had succeeded in
opening. His exertions were cut short by
an invisible battery, which broke down the
walls, wounded his two lieutenants, and
obliged him to fall back. He himself was
wounded twice as he crept through the
ditches.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Second-Lieutenant de Réau, who
came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> out of cover to advance, had his shoulder
shattered. The casualties in the Jeanniot
battalion, whose sections continued the attack,
leaving 110 of their number on the field, soon
became so serious that they had to be brought
back to the rear. It was then that the
"Colonel" of the 2nd Regiment, rallying the
remnants of the companies engaged, and continuing
to cover them towards Keyem, massed
his forces, put himself at their head, and, after
crawling up to within two hundred yards of
the position, hurled himself upon Beerst.
His example electrified his men. This time
they would have allowed themselves to be cut
to pieces sooner than give way. Some of
them had thrown off their great-coats that
they might move more freely. The old
corsair blood was boiling in their veins. It
was no longer a charge, but a boarding of the
enemy's ships, and, as in the heroic days, the
first who sprang upon the deck, pistols in
hand and sword between teeth, was the chief.
The whole crew rushed after the "Colonel"
of the 2nd Regiment, who had become
Commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> Varney again. But as soon as
one house was captured the next had to be
taken by assault. Nevertheless, the attack
progressed. To keep it in heart, the Admiral
sent forward the second battalion of the 1st
Regiment, under Commander Kerros, to support
it, and withdrew the sorely tried Jeanniot
battalion to Dixmude. The Mauros battalion
debouched simultaneously from Vladsloo,
whence it had dislodged the enemy, with the
help of the Belgian Brigade and their armoured
cars; the 5th Allied Division prolonged the
fighting line to the right and in the rear.
The effects of this successful tactical arrangement
were at once felt: the enemy, who had
brought his artillery into action, was groping
about in search of the guns we had brought
along to the north of Dixmude; at 5
o'clock in the afternoon we were in possession
of Beerst. The bayonets were able to take a
rest; they had done yeoman's service; in
the streets and in the farmyards, the ground
was paved with corpses. But night was
falling. The Admiral, who had come up to
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> firing line, ordered Commander Varney
to put the approaches to the village into a
state of defence at once in view of a possible
offensive return of the enemy. The men
obeyed gaily; they were still in the full flush
of their costly victory.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> They had scarcely
begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> to wield their picks, when a counter-order
came from Belgian Headquarters: we
were to fall back upon our former positions!
At 11 o'clock that night the brigade returned
to its quarters at Caeskerke and Saint-Jacques-Cappelle.
The horizon was aflame behind it:
Hoograde, Beerst, and Vladsloo had been
re-occupied by the enemy, who were "setting
the red cock up" on the roofs (<i>i.e.</i>, firing them).</p>

Several officers killed and wounded." (Note-book of Second-Lieutenant
X.) "We have been fighting for five days,"
wrote Second-Lieutenant Gautier on October 22. "The
day before yesterday we resumed the offensive. It was a
bit stiff. Don't be too much upset by the casualty lists.
I should not have said anything about them, but as you
will see them in the papers, I would rather tell you of them
myself. Le Douget, who was in the training companies at
Lorient, was killed at Ghent; De Maussion was killed the
day before yesterday; Hébert, Pertus, and De Mons are
wounded." In his note-book, under date of the 18th,
Gautier adds the names of Second-Lieutenants de Blois and
de Roussille as among the wounded. He gives some
interesting details of the affair itself. A little incident
reported by the Abbé Le H. bears witness to the heroism
and self-sacrifice of the men. "It was at Beerst. A
quartermaster had his leg broken by a bullet in the temporary
trench he was occupying with his company. He
went on fighting. His comrades were obliged to fall back
under a tremendous fire. He refused to be carried away,
and crawled into a ditch, where he killed three Germans
who came creeping up to take him prisoner. Fortunately,
a young Marine, who had been trained by him at Lorient,
could not make up his mind to abandon the quartermaster.
By dint of extraordinary efforts, he managed to reach him
and succeeded in dragging him some three hundred yards to a
house, where he left him under shelter. As he left this house
he himself was wounded in the arm by a bullet. Night was
falling. He came to the dressing-station to have his wound
attended to. I was there. He told me his story with such
infectious emotion that I proposed he should act as guide to
two stretcher-bearers and myself for the purpose of bringing
in the quartermaster. Without a moment's hesitation, he
set out in front of us, heedless of the very real danger.
After a difficult pilgrimage over open ground swept by the
German machine-guns, we were lucky enough to find the
quartermaster and to bring him back into our lines. I
notified the conduct of these two brave fellows to the commanding
officer that same evening, and I hope they received
the reward they deserved."</p></div>

<h2>VII. THE FIRST EFFECTS OF THE BOMBARDMENT</h2>


<p>The Belgian Headquarters Staff had
probably decided that its front on
the Ostend road was too excentric,
and that the line of the Yser would form a
more solid epaulement. And in this case our
diversion on Beerst was not quite useless,
since it had secured the orderly retreat of the
Belgian troops; but, on the other hand, as a
result of this diversion and of the reinforcement
of the German troops, De Mitry had
been unable to maintain himself at Thourout;
the Turcos had returned to Loo, and the rest
of the French cavalry was obliged to follow
the movement. The whole of the ground in
front of Dixmude lay open to the enemy, who,
reinforced by fresh contingents and the heavy
artillery from Antwerp, released by the
capitulation of the city, prepared in all
security to renew the attack upon our positions
in combination with a parallel action on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
lines of the Lower and Middle Yser. In order
to understand clearly what follows, it will be
necessary to remember that the defence of
Dixmude and of the Yser, and, in the event
of the forcing of the Yser, the defence of the
railway from Caeskerke to Nieuport were
closely connected, and that Pervyse and
Ramscappelle lead to Furnes as well as
Dixmude, Pollinchove, or Loo.</p>

<p>A new disposition of the Allied forces was
required under the new conditions. During
the night of October 19 the Belgian Meiser
Brigade passed under the Admiral's orders;
on the 20th at 11 o'clock the first "saucepan"
fell upon Dixmude. "Up to this date,"
writes Captain X., "77 shrapnel, with their
queer caterwaulings, were the only presents the
enemy had sent us. But during the course
of the 20th the big shells began to rain upon
us, and their first objective was, of course,
the church. At the fifth or sixth the beautiful
building was on fire."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> And we had no
observer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> there. In preparation for the bombardment,
we had worked all night at the
trenches. Those nearest to the enemy had
been provided with parapets and barbed
wire entanglements, dug down to a depth of
I metre 70 cm., and strongly roofed. But all
the internal defences remained to be organised,
notably the railway embankment, where the
"big niggers" were falling in showers. One
evening when his company was in reserve,
after forty-eight hours in the trenches,
Lieutenant A. was ordered to take up a
position there. He had been on guard there
three nights before; he knew by experience
how dangerous this spot was, and, less for
his own sake than for the 250 men under his
charge, he thought it his duty to speak out.</p>

<p>"'There are no trenches on the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
slope, Commander,' he remarked to Captain
V.</p>

<p>"'I know that.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, very well, sir.'</p>

<p>"And smiling to encourage his men," added
the eye-witness who reported this dialogue,
"he went off to a post as exposed as a glacis."</p>

<p>With such officers, Dixmude was better
defended than if it had had a triple line of
blockhouses. The men, who were worthy of
their leaders, had soon grown used to the
racket of the shells. The damage they do is
not in proportion to the noise they make,
"for one can see them coming, and they are
heralded by a creaking sound, as of ungreased
pulleys,"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> wrote a Marine to his family,
adding ingenuously: "All the same, anyone
who wants to hear guns has only to come
here." Indeed, the noise was stupendous:
420, 305, and 77 were thundering in unison.
As we had no heavy artillery to reply, we had
to wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> patiently for the inevitable attack
which follows after the ground is cleared.
Then the 72-m. guns of our six groups would
be able to have their say. Unfortunately on
our right the ravages caused in the Belgian
trenches by the storm of German artillery had
made it impossible for our allies to hold their
position; this being duly notified in time,
the Admiral sent four of our companies to
replace them. Scarcely were they installed,
when the German attack began. Sure of themselves
and of victory, they had adopted the
close formation of their first onslaught, with
machine-guns in the rear, the veterans on
the two wings, the conscripts in the centre
and in front, the latter with rapt, ecstatic
faces, the former swelling with the pride of
former victories, all united by the same
patriotic ideal, marching rhythmically, and
singing hymns to the national God. The
majority were young men, hardly more than
boys. Later, in the trenches, when the
Marines fell upon them, they knelt down,
clasping their hands, weeping, and begging
for quarter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> But here, in the excitement
of the <i>mêlée</i>, elbow to elbow and sixteen
ranks deep, they had but one colossal and
ferocious soul. They were swinging along
with a slightly undulating movement when
the fire of our machine-guns struck them,
true sons of those other barbarians who
linked themselves together with chains, that
they might form a solid block in death or in
victory. An aroma of alcohol, ether, and
murder preceded them, as it had been the
breath of the blood-stained machine. Our
men allowed them to approach within a
hundred yards. To the shouts of <i>Vorwärts!</i>
("Forward!") from the enemy's ranks we
answered abruptly by the orders "Independent
fire! Continuous fire!" given by officers
and petty officers. Behind their parapets,
amidst the buzz of bullets and the bursting
of shrapnel, the Marines did not miss a single
shot. "We'll do for you!" yelled the gunners,
catching the contagious fever of battle. The
Germans came on steadily, but the mass was
no longer solid. The dislocated machine was
working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> with difficulty. It uttered its death-rattle
at the foot of the trenches in the network
of barbed wire where the survivors had rolled
over. At 8 o'clock in the evening three blasts
on a whistle, strident as a factory hooter, put
an end to the work of the monstrous organism.</p>

<p>The battle had been raging for six hours in
the night. Once more we were the victors,
but at what a price! Dixmude, which the
enemy's heavy artillery had battered incessantly
during the attack, was not yet the
"heap of pebbles and ashes," the line of
blackened stones, it was presently to become,
but its death agony had begun. Innumerable
houses had been gutted. The entire quarter
round the church was on fire. The rain,
heavy as it was, could not extinguish the
flames kindled by incendiary bombs. A
projectile struck the belfry of Saint Nicolas
at the hour of the Angelus; the great bell,
mortally wounded, uttered a kind of dying
groan, the vibrations of which quivered long
in space. "Poor Dixmude!" cried a sailor;
"your passing bell is tolling." Happily, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>population was no longer on the spot. The
Burgomaster had given the signal of exodus,
and all had obeyed it, stricken to the heart, with
the exception of the Carmelites and some dozen
laggards and stubborn spirits, such as the old
beadle described by M. T'Serstevens, who lived
in a little gabled house with barred windows on
the Grand' Place, and who, pipe in mouth, used
to bring the keys of the church to visitors.
He mumbled the rude Flemish dialect of the
coast, and was tanned by the sea-wind. "The
church, the house, the Place, the old man,
were all in harmony: all embodied the unique
soul of Mother Flanders," and all were
destroyed at the same time; the old man was
unable to disengage himself from his house, of
which he seemed but a more animated stone
than the rest.</p>

THE PARISH CHURCH AFTER THE FIRST DAYS OF THE BOMBARDMENT</span>
</div>

<p>In spite of the retreat of the enemy, the
four companies of Marines had been left at
their posts as a precautionary measure. An
intermittent fusillade to the north of the
Yser during the night suggested a renewed
offensive. The only attack of any moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
took place at 3 o'clock in the morning, "but
we repulsed it easily," notes the Marine R.,
"for in our covered trenches we are invulnerable."
Disappointed, the enemy turned
again towards the town, which he began to
bombard once more at dawn. It chanced
that the weather had cleared. The <i>schoore</i>
smiled; the larks were singing; weary of
lowing for their sheds, or already resigned to
their forsaken condition, the cattle were
ruminating in the sun<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>: and the interminable
line of canals, the silvery surfaces of the
<i>watergands</i>, shone softly on the brown velvet
of the marsh. The sky, however, as says the
Psalmist, armed itself with thunders and
lightnings. The bombardment became particularly
violent in the afternoon. "At given
moments the whole town seemed about to
crumble," writes an officer. "The Germans
had first attacked it with 10-centimetre guns,
then with 15, and then with 21-centimetre;
but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> as this was no good, they determined to
finish off these infernal sailors in grand style
with their 305 and 420-mm."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Our reserves
in Dixmude were of course sorely tried by
this terrible fire, which it was difficult to locate
and still more difficult to silence with defective
guns. To add to the complexities of the situation,
we learned suddenly that at 4 o'clock
the enemy had taken one of the trenches on
the outskirts to the south of the town.
Surprised by an attack in force, the Belgian
section which occupied it gave way after a
spirited resistance, involving the supporting
section of Marines in their rear in their
retreat. Only Lieutenant Cayrol remained
at his post, revolver in hand, to enable his
men to carry off the machine-guns.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Three
companies at once crept along towards the
captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> trenches after our guns had cleared
the approaches a little.</p>

<p>"We tried our hands as marksmen," writes
one of the actors in this scene, "and while the
Boches were trying to re-form, before they
had recovered from their surprise, we fired
into them at 50 metres, and then charged
them with the bayonet. You should have
seen them run like hares, throwing away
their arms and all their equipment. What a
raid it was, five to six hundred dead and
wounded and forty prisoners, among them
three officers! We reoccupied the trenches,
and I spent the night in the company of a dead
Belgian and a wounded German, who, when
he woke up, exclaimed: 'Long live France!'
lest we should run him through. When day
came, and we could behold our work ...
(Here an interval. A shell burst just over my
head, smashed a rifle, and threw a handful of
earth in my face. It was slightly unpleasant.
I continue.) It was a pretty sight. All day
long stretcher-bearers were picking up the
dead and wounded, while we continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
fire from time to time. All the wounded we
have picked up are young men, sixteen to
twenty years old, of the last levy.</p>

<p>"The next night there was a repetition of
these experiences, only this time it was the
northern trenches that failed. As always, it
was the sailors who had to recapture them.
For lack of available forces, we were obliged
to send two companies of the 2nd Regiment,
which had been set aside to act as reliefs; they
put matters right by a little bayonet play."</p>

<p>"You might have supposed that after this
dance we had claims to a turn at the buffet,"
writes a second quartermaster. "Not a bit of
it! My company had been set aside for relief,
and it carried out the relief. It would be
untrue to say that we are not all a bit blown;
but we are holding out all the same. We
called the roll; there were some who did not
answer to their names, and who will not see
their mammies again.... If only we could
move about a bit to stretch our legs! But
we are packed together in the mud like
sardines in their oil. In the morning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
hurly-burly began again, first a few shrapnel,
then from 12 to 1 a perfect whirlwind of
shells of every imaginable calibre. How they
lavish their munitions, the brutes!"</p>

<p>This defence of the Yser was, to quote the
words of Dr. L., "an eternal Penelope's web."
Scarcely had it been mended, when the fabric
gave way at another point. Thanks to the
reinforcements the enemy had received, his
pressure became more violent every day.
Reduced to impotence on the flank of the
defence, where the vigorous attitude of our
sailors deluded him into the belief that he
had to deal with superior numbers, the foe
pushed forward his centre. He succeeded in
driving in a wedge on October 22,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> occupying
Tervaete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> and gaining a footing "for the first
time on the left bank of the Yser."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The
1st Belgian Division, thrown back, but not
broken, sent us word that it would attack
next day, supported by our artillery. We were
further to send them one or two of our reserve
battalions. But the next day Dixmude and
our outer trenches were so furiously bombarded
that we required our total strength to
resist. The Germans were evidently using their
biggest calibres, 21 and perhaps 28-cm. In
spite of all this, their infantry could not get
into our trenches. We had a few casualties,
both killed and wounded, among the latter
Commander Delage, "Colonel" of the 2nd
Regiment, who, when his wound was dressed,
would not stay in the ambulance, but resumed
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> command before he was cured. But
things had not been going so well with our
allies at Tervaete. Checked in a first attempt,
a second and more vigorous counter-attack
succeeded in driving the Germans into the
river or upon the other bank; but this, as the
<i>Courrier de l'Armée Belge</i> admitted, "was a
transitory success, for the same evening
German reinforcements renewed the attack,
and carried Tervaete." Our artillery had
done its best under the circumstances; but,
shouted down by the clamour of the big
German guns, it was not able to keep up the
conversation. "We still have nothing but
the little Belgian guns," wrote Second-Lieutenant
M. on the morning of the 22nd.
"However, we are promised two batteries of
short 155-mm. and two of long 120-mm. They
arrived in the course of the evening. That's
all right! Now perhaps we shall be able to
have a little talk with the Boches!"</p>

<p>But was it not already too late? Dixmude
was impregnable only so long as it was not
taken in the rear; and the enemy, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
finally occupied the whole of the Tervaete
loop, was gradually penetrating into the
valley of the Yser. The last news was that
he had arrived at Stuyvekenskerke. The
42nd French Infantry Division, under General
Grossetti, which was to replace the 2nd
Belgian Division, now reduced to a fourth of
its original strength, on the Yser, had not
yet had time to come up into line. At Dixmude
itself the pressure was formidable;
shells were falling on us from every side, from
Vladsloo, from Eessen, and from Clercken,
whither the Germans had removed their
heavy artillery. And at the same time the
enemy's infantry attacked our trenches regularly
at intervals of an hour, with the stubbornness
of a ram butting at an obstacle, preceding
every attack by a few big shells. It looked as
if they were trying to divert our attention, to
prevent us from noticing what was going on
down below in the hollow of the Yser, where
a grey surge seemed to be seething, and where
the <i>schoore</i> appeared to be moving towards
Oud Stuyvekenskerke. But the movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
had not escaped the Admiral, who was
watching it from Caeskerke. Whence had
these troops come&mdash;from Tervaete, from
Stuyvekenskerke, or elsewhere? We could
not say, and it mattered little. At whatever
point a breach had been made in the defences
of the Middle Yser, the German tide had crept
up to us: Dixmude was turned.</p>

<p>In this, the most critical situation in which
the brigade had yet been placed, the Admiral
had only his reserves and a few Belgian contingents
at his disposal. To bar the way to
the bridges of Dixmude, Commander Rabot,
with a battalion, hurried to the support of the
left wing of the front. Commander Jeanniot,
with another battalion, crept up towards
Oud Stuyvekenskerke, to support the Belgians,
having received orders to occupy the outskirts
at least. The man&oelig;uvre was a peculiarly
difficult one to carry out, under a raking fire,
and with men already dropping with fatigue
and perishing with cold and drowsiness.
But these men were sailors.</p>

<p>"On October 24," writes the Marine F., of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> island of Sein, "we had spent a day and
a night in the first line. That night we had
two men killed in our trench and four wounded
by a shell, and we were going to the rear
for a little well-earned rest. Scarcely had we
swallowed our coffee, when the order came to
clear the decks, as we say on board ship,
and shoulder our knapsacks. When we got
nearer, the bullets began to whistle. We
crawled on all fours over the exposed ground,
without a shred of cover. Those who ventured
to raise their heads were at once
wounded, though we could see nothing of the
Germans. We got so accustomed to the
bullets whizzing past our ears that we lost
all fear and advanced steadily."</p>

<p>That day, however, our worthy Marine got
no further. In the thick of the firing, a
bullet broke his leg, and sent him rolling over
into a pool. But as he was a Breton, with a
great respect for Madame Saint Anne of
Le Porzic, he made a vow that if he got off
without further damage, he would give her
on the day of her "pardon" a fine white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
marble ex-voto, with "Thanks to Saint Anne
for having preserved me" engraved upon it.</p>

<p>All his comrades were not so fortunate, and
at the close of the day the majority of the
officers engaged, notably those of the second
and third battalions of the 1st Regiment,
were <i>hors de combat</i>. But we held the outskirts
of Oud Stuyvekenskerke; Commander
Jeanniot and the Belgian troops, with Commander
Rabot, had succeeded, according to
the Admiral's instructions, in forming a line of
defence facing north, which bid defiance to
the enemy's attacks. Moreover, heavy as our
losses were, they were nothing as compared
with those of the Germans. The following
dispirited comments were found in the note-book
of a German officer of the 202nd Regiment
of Infantry killed at Oud Stuyvekenskerke the
following day:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are losing men on every hand, and
our losses are out of all proportion to the
results obtained. Our guns do not succeed
in silencing the enemy's batteries; our infantry
attacks are ineffectual: they only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
lead to useless butchery. Our losses must be
enormous. My colonel, my major, and many
other officers are dead or wounded. All our
regiments are mixed up together; the enemy's
merciless fire enfilades us. They have a
great many <i>francs-tireurs</i> with them."</p>

<p><i>Francs-tireurs!</i> We know what the
Germans understand by this term, which
merely means skilled marksmen.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> If our
sailors had not been so hitherto, the night
attack which crowned this tragic day showed
that they had become so. The attack was
unprecedented and of unparalleled fury.
Between 5 p.m. and midnight we and the
Belgians had to repulse no less than fifteen
attacks on the south sector of the defence,
and eleven on the north and east sectors.
The enemy charged with the cries of wild
beasts, and for the first time our men saw
the brutish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> face of War. The next day, as
soon as the mists lifted, the battle began again
along the whole line. The town was bombarded,
the outer trenches, the trenches of the
Yser, and, above all, the railway station at
Caeskerke, where the Admiral was. He had to
resign himself to a change of quarters without
gaining much in the way of safety. The
enemy had spies in Dixmude itself. "The
houses of the Staff were spotted one after
the other as soon as any change was made,"
writes an officer; "and every day at noon,
when we were at our midday meal, we were
greeted by four big shells. Scarcely had a
heavy battery been in position for five
minutes, when the position became untenable:
a man in a tree a hundred yards off was
quietly making signals."</p>

<p>In the north alone a certain relaxation of the
enemy's pressure was noted. Abandoning the
attempt to turn Dixmude by way of Oud
Stuyvekenskerke, the Germans seemed anxious
to push on to Pervyse and Ramscappelle,
from which they were only separated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
embankment of the Nieuport railway. The
Grossetti Division endeavoured to stop the
way with the remnant of the Belgian divisions,
and sent a battalion of the 19th Chasseurs to
relieve us at Oud Stuyvekenskerke. Commander
Jeanniot at once went into the
reserve trenches of the sector. His men were
utterly worn out. The companies which had
occupied the outer trenches of the defence,
and which had not been relieved for four days,
were not less exhausted. The enemy's fire on
the Dixmude front never ceased, the town
heaved and shuddered at every blast, the
paving stones were dislodged, every window
was shattered, houses were perpetually crumbling
into heaps of rubble, and after each explosion
immense spirals of black smoke rose
as high as 100 metres above the craters made
by the shells. "During the night of Sunday,
the 25th," notes the Marine R., on duty with
Commander Mauros, of the third battalion,
"we were thrice obliged to evacuate the houses
in which we were, as they fell in upon us."
"Dixmude is gradually crumbling away,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
wrote Lieutenant S. on the following day.
The Carmelites had left on October 21;
their monastery, where the chaplains of the
brigade<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> continued to officiate imperturbably,
had received three big shells during the day.
The belfry still held, but it had lost three of
its turrets, and the charming Gothic façade
of the town-hall had a great hole in the first
storey. It looked like a piece of lace through
which a clumsy fist had been thrust. The
enemy did not even spare our ambulances.
"A chapel in the middle of the town, protected
by the Red Cross (Hospital of St. John), was
shelled from end to end," says Marine F. A.,
of Audierne; "not a single one of the surrounding
churches and belfries has been left
standing."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The worst of it was that our
forces, greatly tried in the last encounters, no
longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> sufficed for the exigencies of the defence.
We had to be making constant appeals to
the dépôts. The winter rains had begun,
flooding the trenches. If it had not been for
the heavy cloth overcoats insisted on by a
far-seeing administration, the men would
have died of cold. Many who through
carelessness, or in the hurry of departure, had
left their bags at Saint-Denis, went shivering
on guard in cotton vests, their bare feet in
ragged slippers. All their letters are full of
imprecations against the horrible water that
was benumbing them, diluting the clay, and
encasing them in a shell of mud.</p>

<h2>VIII. THE INUNDATION</h2>


<p>A new actor was about to appear on
the scene, a new ally, slower, but
infinitely more effectual, than the
best reinforcements.</p>

<p>Last November the <i>Moniteur Belge</i> published
a royal decree conferring the Order of
Leopold upon M. Charles Louis Kogge, <i>garde
wateringue</i> of the north of Furnes, for his
courageous and devoted services in the work
of inundation in the Yser region.</p>

<p>It was, we have been told, this M. Kogge who
first conceived the idea of calling the waters to
our aid. A more romantic version has it
that the notion was suggested to the Headquarters
Staff by the singularly opportune
discovery of a bundle of old revolutionary
documents bearing upon the action brought
in 1795 by a Flemish farmer against his landlord
"to recover damages for the loss he had
suffered through the inundation of his land
during the defence of Nieuport." Be this as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
it may, on the evening of October 25 the
Belgian General Headquarters Staff informed
the Admiral that it had just taken measures
to inundate the left bank of the Yser between
that river and the railway line from Dixmude
to Nieuport.</p>

<p>The effects of this inundation could not,
however, be felt for the first day or two, or
even for those immediately following. The
word inundation generally suggests to the
mind the image of a torrential rush of water,
a great charge of marine or fluvial cavalry
which sweeps all before it. There was nothing
of the sort in this case. We were in Western
Belgium, in an invertebrate country, without
relief of any sort, where everything proceeds
slowly and phlegmatically, even cataclysms.
It is, perhaps, a pity that there is not another
word in the language to describe the hydrographic
operation we were about to witness;
but in default of a substantive there is a verb,
which surprised most readers of the <i>communiqués</i>
as a neologism, but which, as a fact,
has been used in Flanders from time immemorial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and has the advantage of expressing
the nature of the operation most admirably.
It is the verb <i>tendre</i> (to spread or stretch).
They <i>spread</i> an inundation there as fishermen
spread a net. No image could be more
exact. The <i>spreader</i>, in this case, was at
the locks of Nieuport. He is a head <i>wateringue</i>,
commanding a dozen men armed with levers
to manipulate the lifting-jacks. At high tide
he had the flood-gates raised; the sea entered,
forcing back the fresh water of the canal and
its tributaries; and the sea did not run out
again, for the flood-gates had been lowered.
Henceforth the fresh water which flowed on
every side into the basin of the Yser will
find no outlet; "without haste and without
rest" it will add its contribution to that
of the tide; it will gradually overflow the
dykes of the collecting canals, will reach the
<i>watergands</i>, and cover the whole <i>schoore</i> with
its meshes. Slily, noiselessly, unceasingly,
it will rise on a soil already saturated like
a sponge and incapable of absorbing another
drop of water. All that falls there, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
it come from the sky in the form of rain, or
from the hills of Cassel in the form of torrents,
will remain on the surface. There is no way
of checking the inundation as long as the
flood-gates are not raised. He who holds
Nieuport holds the entire district by means
of its locks. This explains the persistence of
the Germans in their attempts to capture it.
Fortunately, these attempts were somewhat
belated; they tried a surprise by the dunes of
Lombaertzide and Middelkerke, which might
perhaps have succeeded but for the timely
co-operation of the Anglo-French fleet with
the Belgian troops: the German attack was
driven back by the fire of the monitors, and
failed to carry the locks of Nieuport. The
inundation continued. When its last meshes
were woven and all its web complete, it was to
spread in a semicircle on a zone of 30 kilometres,
and this immense artificial lagoon,
from four to five kilometres wide and from
three to four feet deep, in which light squadrons
and batteries might have engaged if hard
pressed, but for the abrupt depressions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
<i>watergands</i> and collecting canals, forming
invisible traps at every step, was to constitute
the most impregnable defensive front,
a liquid barrier defying all attacks. Dixmude,
at the extremity of this lagoon, in the blind
alley here formed by the Yser, the Handzaeme
Canal, and the railway embankment, might
aptly be compared to Quiberon; like Quiberon,
it would be, were its bridges destroyed, a
sort of thin, low peninsula; but it is a
Flemish Quiberon anchored upon a motionless
sea, without waves and without tides, studded
with tree-tops and telegraph poles, and bearing
on its dead waters the drifting corpses of
soldiers and animals, pointed helmets, empty
cartridge-cases and food-tins.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<h2>IX. THE MURDER OF COMMANDER JEANNIOT</h2>


<p>On October 25 we had not yet received
any help from the inundation. Our
troops were in dire need of rest, and
the enemy was tightening his grip along the
entire front. New reinforcements were coming
up to fill the gaps in his ranks; our scouts
warned us that fresh troops were marching
upon Dixmude by the three roads of Eessen,
Beerst, and Woumen.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> We had to expect a
big affair the next day, if not that very night.
It came off that night.</p>

<p>About 7 o'clock the Gamas company went
to relieve the men in the southern trenches.
On their way, immediately outside the town,
they fell in with a German force of about the
same strength as themselves, which had crept
up no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> one knew how. There was a fusillade
and a general <i>mêlée</i>, in which our sailors
opened a passage through the troop with
bayonets and butt-ends, disposing of some
forty Germans and putting the rest to
flight.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Then there was a lull. The splash
of rain was the only sound heard till 2 a.m.,
when suddenly a fresh outbreak of rifle-fire
was heard near the Caeskerke station, right
inside the defences. It was suggested that
our men or our allies, exasperated by their
life of continual alarms, had been carried away
by some reckless impulse. The bravest soldiers
admit that hallucinations are not uncommon
at night in the trenches. All the pitfalls of
darkness rise before the mind; the circulation
of the blood makes a noise like the tramp of
marching troops; if by chance a nervous
sentry should fire his rifle, the whole section
will follow suit.</p>

<p>Convinced that some misunderstanding of
this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> kind had taken place, the Staff, still
quartered at the Caeskerke railway station,
shouted to the sections to cease firing. As,
however, the fusillade continued in the
direction of the town, the Admiral sent one
of his officers, Lieutenant Durand-Gasselin,
to reconnoitre. He got as far as the Yser
without finding the enemy; the fusillade had
ceased; the roads were clear. He set out on
his way back to Caeskerke. On the road he
passed an ambulance belonging to the brigade
going up towards Dixmude, which, on being
challenged, replied: "Rouge Croix."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Rather
surprised at this inversion, he stopped the
ambulance; it was full of Germans, who,
however, surrendered without offering any
resistance. But this capture suggested a new
train of thought to the Staff: they were now
certain that there had been an infantry raid
upon the town; the Germans in the ambulance
probably belonged to a troop of mysterious
assailants who had made their way into
Dixmude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> in the night and had vanished no
less mysteriously after this extraordinary deed
of daring. One of our covering trenches must
have given way, but which? Our allies
held the railway line by which the enemy
had penetrated into the defences, sounding
the charge.... The riddle was very disturbing,
but under the veil of a thick damp
night, which favoured the enemy, it was
useless to seek a solution. It was found next
morning at dawn, when one of our detachments
on guard by the Yser suddenly noticed in a
meadow a curious medley of Belgians, French
Marines, and Germans. Had our men been
made prisoners? This uncertainty was of
brief duration. There was a sharp volley;
the sailors fell; the Germans made off. This
was what had happened:</p>

<p>Various versions have been given of this
incident, one of the most dramatic of the
defence, in the course of which the heroic
Commander Jeanniot and Dr. Duguet, chief
officer of the medical staff, fell mortally
wounded, with several others. The general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
opinion, however, seems to be that the German
attack, which was delivered at 2.30 a.m.,
was closely connected with the surprise movement
attempted at 7 o'clock in the evening on
the Eessen road and so happily frustrated by
the intervention of the Gamas company. It is
not impossible that it was carried out by the
fragments of the force we had scattered,
reinforced by new elements and charging to
the sound of the bugle. This would explain
the interval of several hours between the two
attacks, which were no doubt the outcome of a
single inspiration.</p>

<p>"The night," says an eye-witness, "was
pursuing its normal course, and as there were
no indications of disturbance, Dr. Duguet
took the opportunity to go and get a little
rest in the house where he was living, which
was just across the street opposite his ambulance.
The Abbé Le Helloco, chaplain of the
2nd Regiment, had joined him at about 1.30
a.m. The latter admits that he was rather
uneasy because of the earlier skirmish, in which
as was his habit, he had been unremitting in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
ministrations to the wounded. After a few
minutes' talk the two men separated to
seek their straw pallets. The Abbé had been
asleep for an hour or two, when he was
awakened by shots close at hand. He roused
himself and went to Dr. Duguet, who was
already up. The two did not exchange a
word. Simultaneously, without taking the
precaution of extinguishing the lights behind
them, they hurried to the street. Enframed
by the lighted doorway, they at once became a
target; a volley brought them down in a
moment. Dr. Duguet had been struck by a
bullet in the abdomen; the Abbé was hit
in the head, the arm, and the right thigh.
The two bodies were touching each other.
'Abbé,' said Dr. Duguet, 'we are done
for. Give me absolution. I regret ...' The
Abbé found strength to lift his heavy arm
and to make the sign of the cross upon his
dying comrade. Then he fainted, and this
saved him. Neither he nor Dr. Duguet had
understood for the moment what was happening.
Whence had the band of marauders who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
had struck them down come, and how had
they managed to steal into our lines without
being seen? It was a mystery. This fusillade
breaking out behind them had caused a certain
disorder in the sections nearest to it, who
thought they were being taken in the rear,
and who would have been, indeed, had the
attack been maintained. The band arrived in
front of the ambulance station at the moment
when the staff (three Belgian doctors, a few
naval hospital orderlies, and Quartermaster
Bonnet) were attending to Dr. Duguet, who
was still breathing. They made the whole
lot prisoners and carried them along in their
idiotic rush through the streets. Both officers
and soldiers must have been drunk. This is
the only reasonable explanation of their mad
venture. We held all the approaches to
Dixmude; the brief panic that took place in
certain sections had been at once controlled.
The improbability of a night attack inside
the defences was so great that Commander
Jeanniot, who had been in reserve that night,
and who, roused by the firing like Dr. Duguet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and Abbé Le Helloco, had gone into the
street to call his sector to arms, had not even
taken his revolver in his hand. Mistaking the
identity and the intentions of the groups he
saw advancing, he ran towards them to
reassure them and bring them back to the
trenches. This little stout, grizzled officer,
rough and simple in manner, was adored by the
sailors. He was known to be the bravest of
the brave, and he himself was conscious of
his power over his men. When he recognised
his mistake it was too late. The Germans
seized him, disarmed him, and carried him
off with loud '<i>Hochs!</i>' of satisfaction. The
band continued to push on towards the Yser,
driving a few fugitives before them, and a part
of them succeeded in crossing the river under
cover of the general confusion. Happily this
did not last long. Captain Marcotte de Sainte-Marie,
who was in command of the guard on the
bridge, identified the assailants with the help
of a searchlight, and at once opened fire upon
them.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The majority of the Germans within
range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> of our machine-guns were mown down;
the rest scattered along the streets and ran
to cellars and ruins to hide themselves. But
the head of the column had got across with
its prisoners, whom they drove before them
with the butt-ends of their rifles.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> For four
hours they wandered about, seeking an issue
which would enable them to rejoin their lines.
It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> was raining the whole time. Weary of
wading through the mud, the officers stopped
behind a hedge to hold a council. A pale
light began to pierce the mist; day was
dawning, and they could no longer hope to
regain the German lines in a body. Prudence
dictated that they should disperse until
nightfall. But what was to be done with the
prisoners? The majority voted that they
should be put to death. The Belgian doctors
protested. Commander Jeanniot, who took
no part in the debate, was talking calmly to
Quartermaster Bonnet. At a sign from their
leader the Boches knelt and opened fire upon
the prisoners. The Commander fell, and as he
was still breathing, they finished him off with
their bayonets. The only survivors were the
Belgian doctors, who had been spared, and
Quartermaster Bonnet, who had only been
hit in the shoulder. It was at this moment
that the marauders were discovered. One
section charged them forthwith; another fell
back to cut off their retreat. What happened
afterwards? Some accounts declare that the
German officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> learned what it costs to
murder prisoners, and that our men despatched
the dogs there and then; but the truth is,
that, in spite of the general desire to avenge
Commander Jeanniot, the whole band was
taken prisoner and brought before the Admiral,
who had only the three most prominent
rascals of the gang executed."</p>

<p>Another very interesting account of this
episode has been communicated to us by
M. Charles Thomas Couture, chauffeur to
Commander Varney.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">An Unpublished Account of the Murder
of Commander Jeanniot.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dixmude</span>, <i>Monday, October 26, 1914</i>.</p>

<p>Yesterday we were informed that a certain number
of Germans, slipping between the trenches, had
managed to get into Dixmude. Search was made in
the houses and cellars, and we collected a few
prisoners.</p>

<p>This incident caused us some uneasiness, and as
the bombardment, which generally ceased at night,
continued persistently, I hesitated to go to bed.
Shells were bursting quite close to our inn, the front
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> which was peppered with bullets. Fortunately,
the shells were shrapnel, annoying rather than
deadly, and as I was very tired, I made up my
mind to get a sleep about 10 o'clock. But I lay
down fully dressed and armed; I did not even lay
aside my revolver.</p>

<p>One after the other the inhabitants of the inn
followed my example. There were four of us:
Commander Varney, Captain Monnot, Lieutenant
Bonneau, and myself. Dr. Duguet and Abbé Le
Helloco, who generally shared our straw, were
detained at the ambulance by some severe cases, and
were not expected to come in before 1 o'clock in the
morning. By this time all was quiet, and the
bombardment had ceased.</p>

<p>At 3 a.m. a cyclist rushed in, crying: "Get up!
The Boches are coming!" I did not for a moment
imagine that the enemy had crossed the bridge over
the Yser, which was some 80 or 100 metres in front
of us. I thought that the Germans had forced the
sailors' trenches in front of Dixmude, that they had
entered the town in force, and that the line of defence
was to be brought back to the canal. If such were
the case, it was necessary to get my car ready to
start immediately. As soon as I was awake I accordingly
went out by the front door of the inn, and going
to my car, I began to pump up the petrol. Commander
Varney had come out at the same time.</p>

<p>Our common living-room was feebly lighted by a
lantern, but this sufficed to throw the figures of those
who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> who passed into the embrasure of the door into
strong relief. This was the case a few minutes later
when Dr. Duguet and Abbé Le Helloco emerged. I
was bending down over my car, quite in the dark.</p>

<p>At this moment a body of brawlers passed along
the road, coming from the bridge and going towards
the level crossing. They were preceded by a bugler,
very much out of tune. In spite of the lights and
the reports of firearms among the band, I only
realised after they had passed that they were the
enemy.</p>

<p>But as soon as I grasped the fact I recognised that
there was no question of getting out the car just
then, so I followed Commander Varney, who was
near me. "What shall I do, Commander?"
"Above all things, don't let them take you prisoner."
Subsequent events made me appreciate the wisdom
of this order.</p>

<p>The Commander disappeared in the night, going
towards the Yser to see what was happening. I
went back into the inn by the back door, and there,
stretched on the ground side by side, I found the
doctor and the Abbé, on whom the Germans had
fired at very short range. Both were wounded in
the abdomen. Probably the same bullets went
through them both. The doctor murmured: "I am
hit in the loins; I can't move my legs." The Abbé
seemed to have but one thought: "I won't fall into
the hands of the Germans alive." But he managed
to give absolution to our poor doctor.</p>

<p>I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> went out of the inn again, and back to the
motors, to see what was happening. I found the
cook and the orderlies there; they had taken their
rifles and were awaiting events. I joined them,
holding my revolver in my hand.</p>

<p>What gave me most anxiety was that not a sound
came from the line of the trenches. The rifles were
all silent; no night had been so calm. I began to
wonder if by some extraordinary surprise all the
sailors had been taken prisoners.</p>

<p>As we knew that the enemy troop had passed us
and gone towards the level crossing, we took our
stand, in view of their possible return, at the corner
of a neighbouring house, where the Belgian soldiers
were quartered.</p>

<p>Captain Ferry, who had been wounded a few
days before and had his left arm in a sling,
joined us.</p>

<p>A suspicious rumbling was heard on the road.
Captain Ferry advanced completely out of cover to
reconnoitre. He found himself face to face with a
band of Germans who barred the road level with the
other corner of the Belgians' house.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried the captain; "you are my
prisoners."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied a voice in guttural French.
"It's you who are our prisoners."</p>

<p>This somewhat comic dialogue was not continued,
for the sailors Mazet and Pinardeau fired. The
Germans never even attempted to retort; they
allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> Captain Ferry to rejoin us quietly, and
disappeared into the ditch by the road.</p>

<p>It was now half-past three. The alarm was over,
and had lasted barely half an hour. Our little party
took refuge in the cowshed, for the German guns had
begun to send us shrapnel shells, which exploded
high in the air, but nevertheless covered us with
fragments. All we could do was to wait for the
day, which at this date broke about half-past four.
Lieutenant Bonneau had brought a half-section of
sailors to our inn, and these began to explore the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Some Belgian soldiers joined the sailors, and a
<i>battue</i> of Boches began in the marshy meadows.
We heard cries of "There they are! There they
are!" and shots were fired; then "Don't fire,
they are sailors." Presently it was all over, and
prisoners passed on their way to the Admiral, who
was installed at the level crossing.</p>

<p>We then heard that nothing at all had happened
in the trenches. The troop that had attacked us
was composed of Boches who had managed to creep
into the town secretly. Led by one or two officers,
they had crossed the bridge over the canal, killing
the sentries, seriously wounding Lieutenant de
Lambertye, and then pushing forward. As they
passed they went into the houses that showed lights,
notably that occupied by the staff of the 1st Regiment,
where they killed two cooks and wounded a
chauffeur. As we have seen, they then shot our
doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> and our chaplain, and their military operations
ended herewith, for their subsequent deeds were
murder pure and simple.</p>

<p>I was told the story at dawn, when I found myself
face to face with Quartermaster Bonnet, chauffeur to
the adjutant-major, who, to my great surprise, had
his right arm in a sling. "Well, M. Couture," he said,
"I shan't be able to drive Captain Monnot any
more." I questioned him, and he then told me that
he, assisted by some Belgian orderlies and doctors,
had gone out to take Dr. Duguet to the ambulance.
Suddenly the party found themselves face to face
with the German troop, which was returning. The
Boches seized the stretcher-bearers, and the doctor
was left by the side of the ditch. Perhaps he was
finished off there.</p>

<p>The Germans had several other prisoners, notably
Commander Jeanniot. This remarkable man, who
was no less beloved than esteemed, was with the first
battalion, which he commanded, in reserve some
distance to the rear. The noise and the shots awoke
him, and he came out alone upon the road to see
what was happening. The Germans crouching in the
ditches had no difficulty in seizing him, and his five
stripes made them realise the importance of their
capture.</p>

<p>In all there were some dozen prisoners, whom the
Germans carried along with them across the fields,
and whom they did not scruple to put in front of
them during the firing. This explains the hesitation
shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> shown during the chase. Seeing that they were
caught, the German officers were not long in making
up their minds. "Shoot the prisoners!" It must
be noted that there was a certain reluctance in the
German ranks, perhaps even a certain opposition to
this barbarous order. We learned later that the
recalcitrants were Berlin students who had volunteered
for service. Was this a movement of humanity or
merely a measure of precaution taken with a view to
their own fate?</p>

<p>However, there are always some ready to carry out
brutal orders. The Mausers were fired at the heads
of the prisoners. Commander Jeanniot was struck
by several bullets, the whole of the front of his skull
being blown off. Several of the Belgians fell. My
comrade Bonnet, if I understood him aright, made the
movement of a child who dodges a box on the ear.
That saved him; the bullet aimed at his head went
into his right shoulder. At this moment he saw our
sailors and the Belgians coming up, and running as
fast as he could lay legs to the ground, he called to
them: "Go at them; there are only about forty
of them left." The rest had made off across the
fields.</p>

<p>At 7 a.m. they were all prisoners.</p>

<p>The Admiral at once decided that the murderers
should be shot there and then. But as Frenchmen
are not given to wholesale executions, the prisoners
who had been rescued were called upon to point out
the ringleaders.</p>

<p>A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> few seconds later four volleys told me that
military justice had taken its rapid course.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment the body of Commander
Jeanniot was carried in. His cyclists and
his chauffeur would not allow anyone but themselves
to render him this last service. They carried their
chief on a stretcher borne on their shoulders, and all
had tears in their eyes.</p>

<p>The rest of the morning was quiet. A German
effort was being made further to the north, where we
heard furious fighting.</p>

<p>As we were drinking our coffee the Senegalese
riflemen arrived to support the sailors. They were
received with joy, for the brigade was much
exhausted.</p></blockquote>

Belgians, sailors, and perhaps some marauders&mdash;and the
level crossing near the station of Caeskerke where the
column was finally stopped. It was in this part of the
street that Dr. Duguet had his dressing-station; and it
was there, too, that Commander Jeanniot, whose reserve
post was at Caeskerke, came out to meet the assailants.
And it was the fields near the south bank of the Yser to
which the column betook itself, dragging its prisoners with
it, when it found the road barred." (See M. Thomas

<h2>X. IN THE TRENCHES</h2>


<p>Thus ended this dramatic episode, of
which neither the genesis nor the
results have been fully elucidated so
far. Did the German troop which overran
the town during the night, and of which only
a portion got away to the meadows with the
prisoners, consist of a battalion or a half-battalion?
The fire of Captain Marcotte de
Sainte-Marie's guns had laid a good many
of the enemy low. "We were walking over
their corpses in the street," wrote Marine
H. G.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The next day we turned a fair
number of the assailants out of the cellars
where they had hidden. But the majority,
aided by mysterious accomplices, certainly
managed to escape.</p>

<p>In any case, the surprise had been a sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>lesson, showing us how necessary it was that
our positions should be immediately reinforced.
The Admiral represented this to Headquarters,
and two battalions of Senegalese were
despatched from Loo. Meanwhile the bombardment
had been resumed. It became very
intense between eleven and three o'clock, and
was directed mainly to the bridges of Dixmude
and the trenches in the cemetery. We had
some heavy casualties there, notably Lieutenant
Eno<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and part of the seventh company of the
second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> battalion. But the <i>moral</i> of the men
was perfectly maintained. We may cite the
case of Quartermaster Leborgne, wounded
in the head and taken to the dressing-station
during a lull in the fighting, who escaped when
he heard the cannonade resumed and came
back to die at his post, or the bugler Chaupin,
who, seeing the recruits arching their backs
under the hail of bullets, cried, "Look at me,
little ones," and drawing himself up to his
full height with magnificent bravery, crossed
the danger zone, carrying his comrades along
in the wake of his heroism.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Thanks to
the reconnaissances of his airmen and the
spies he had in the town, the enemy's fire was
surprisingly accurate. "In the space of two
hours, from half-past ten to half-past twelve
in the morning," wrote one of the officers who
commanded a much-exposed section, Second-Lieutenant
T. S., "some fifty shrapnel shells
fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> round us. At one o'clock a quarter of
my men were out of action. I asked for
reinforcements and provisions; we had been
in the firing line for sixty hours. The Commander
gave me a verbal order to fall back.
I consulted my petty officers and my men.
'Shall we fall back without being relieved?'
'We can't do it, Lieutenant.' An hour
later I received a written order to abandon
the trench. I had to obey, after we had
buried our dead and carried off our wounded.
You see, dear parents, what our sailors will
do: they will hold out to the last gasp. That
same evening the trench was occupied by
another section of the brigade."</p>

<p>And that same evening of October 26 this
trench&mdash;or another&mdash;was again attacked, and
was only saved for us by a prodigy of heroism.
The enemy had advanced to within a few
yards, and charged, shouting "Hurrah!"
Our machine-guns were very dirty and would
not work.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But Lieutenant Martin des
Pallières<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> was in command of the section.
It was holding the road to Woumen, between
the wall of the cemetery and a trench dug
on the other side in a beetroot field. Des
Pallières sprang upon the parapet.</p>

<p>"Boys," he cried, "we must receive these
gentry with cold steel. Fix bayonets!"</p>

<p>And when one of the Marines, a Parisian,
who had charged too vigorously, lamented
the loss of his "hat-pin" (his bayonet), which
he had left in a German hide, Des Pallières
replied: "Do as I do; charge with your
head."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The next day he was killed by a shell.</p>

<p>Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> the brigade had passed under
the command of General Grossetti, who had
undertaken the defence of the line of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Yser as far as, and inclusive of, Dixmude
(detachment of the army of Belgium under
General d'Urbal). The day of the 27th
passed without an attack in force; the enemy
merely bombarded us. He gave us time to
breathe the following night and morning
till 9 a.m. Then the hurly-burly began again.
An officer of the Naval Reserve who received
his baptism of fire that day, Lieutenant
Alfred de la Barre de Nanteuil, grandson of
General Le Flô, wrote to his family that he
had been specially favoured. "It was a fine
christening, plenty of sweetmeats, the whole
show, bullets, shrapnel, and, above all, the
famous 'saucepans' (<i>marmites</i>). Chance
treated me well." In his section alone there
were four killed, twelve wounded, and eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
missing. This was the prelude to a sudden
attack, directed against the trenches in the
cemetery, to which the enemy paid particular
attention. But we knew this, and had put
our steadiest troops there. The attack was
again repulsed, thanks mainly to the firmness
of the first musketry instructor, Le Breton,
who had already been wounded on the 24th,
and who took command of the company
when all the officers had been put out of
action.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> allies were less fortunate on the line
from Dixmude to Nieuport, where the 4th
Belgian Division, overwhelmed by superior
numbers, had to fall back beyond Ramscappelle
and Pervyse. The strategic importance of
these two villages made it imperative to
retake them immediately. Every available
man was sent from the brigade on the evening
of the 29th. This did not prevent the enemy
from continuing his bombardment of Dixmude,
to which this time we were able to reply very
efficaciously with our heavy artillery. This
secured us a fairly quiet night. Such nights
were few and far between in the brigade.
"We don't know what it is to sleep," wrote
a sailor. "We haven't closed our eyes for
ten days." Perhaps the enemy was as weary
as our men. His sole manifestation that
night was to send a few shrapnel shells upon
Caeskerke and the cross-roads where the
Admiral had taken up his position. Perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
too, he was less interested in Dixmude than
in Ramscappelle and Pervyse at this stage of
the operations. At dawn he rushed Ramscappelle,
but he was repulsed at Pervyse, which
the two companies of Rabot's battalion
defended with their accustomed vigour. The
night before, however, the railway bridge of
Dixmude had been demolished by a big shell.</p>

<p>In the brief intervals of this exhausting
struggle, the eyes of the defenders were turned
inquiringly on the <i>schoore</i> of the Yser. How
slowly the inundation announced by the
Belgian Headquarters Staff on the 25th
seemed to be spreading! The progress it had
made in five days was almost imperceptible.
And yet surely it was advancing now on the
great level plain; the <i>watergands</i> were overflowing;
the meshes of the watery net were
drawing together and encircling villages and
farms. Near Ramscappelle and Pervyse it
had already formed a large continuous
expanse.</p>

<p>That day the first tactical effects of the
inundation made themselves felt on our north.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Ramscappelle had been retaken by the 42nd
Division in a brilliant bayonet charge; the
enemy had been driven back behind the embankment
of the Dixmude-Nieuport railway,
whence he had almost immediately retired upon
the Yser: he was falling back not only before
our troops, but before the insidious rising of
the waters. The plan of the German General
Staff was foiled. In their attempt upon Dunkirk
they had not reckoned upon the intervention
of the Anglo-French fleet, which
prevented them from making their way along
the dunes of the seashore, nor upon the
advantages offered to the defence by the
inundation of the basin of the Yser. The key
of the position was neither at Dixmude,
Pervyse, Ramscappelle, nor Ypres, as they had
supposed, but in the pocket of the head
<i>wateringue</i> in charge of the locks at Nieuport.</p>

<p>At this moment of the crisis a certain
vacillation seemed to prevail in the councils
of the enemy. The German Staff, though
they had not forgotten Dixmude, were apparently
casting their eyes in other directions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
On the 30th and 31st they barely sent their
daily ration of shrapnel and big shells to our
trenches in the cemetery and the houses near
the bridge. It had been raining incessantly
for three days; our men were standing half-way
up their legs in water in the trenches.
What had become of the spruce "young
ladies with the red pompons" of the early
days? "You should see us walk," wrote a
sailor, one L., of Audierne. "We are like
old fellows of seventy. I have no feeling in
my poor knees and elbows." But the most
severe suffering was caused by want of socks;
the men could hardly stand on their naked
feet, purple with cold, in their hard boots.
"This is the campaign of frozen toes," says
one of the sufferers. Inured to discipline
and naturally fatalistic, they did not complain,
and looked to their families to help them in
their trouble. "Do send me some socks.
I have to go barefoot, and it is very cold,"
wrote one sailor, J. F., of Le Passage Lauriec;
and in his next letter he repeats: "I can tell
you, my dear parents, that the weather is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
very bad here, rain and wind every day, and
the cold! Sleeping in the trenches is not
very easy. I have not closed my eyes for a
fortnight, what with the cold and the shells
and bullets. Still I keep a good heart. My
feet are bare in my shoes, and they are always
icy cold. If you send me some socks, will
you put some tobacco in with them?"
Another letter is in the same strain: "Dear
mother, you say my brother is still drinking,
and this is very wrong of him, but that he
took the socks off his own feet to send them
to me. I thank him very much, for I did
want them badly." The Breton drunkard
can be generous!</p>

<p>There were lucky ones here as elsewhere.
Such was H. L., who made himself some
mittens with a pair of old socks found in a
German trench. Men are not very squeamish
in war-time, when they have been wearing the
same ragged filthy garments for a month.
"You could not touch my vest with a pair of
tongs, it is so dirty," wrote the same H. L.
to his sister. The officers were no better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
off, except that they had socks. "We
never change; we never wash; we never brush
our hair," wrote Alfred de Nanteuil. "I have
been living in the same grime ever since I left
Brest. The only things I have changed are
my socks. All my ideas of hygiene are upset,
for, on the whole, I have never felt so well."
Some few complain of the food. "I have
been three days in the trenches without enough
to eat," grumbles one sailor J. L. R. But the
majority declare that the tinned meat was
not bad, especially when it was warmed, and
that, on the whole, they got enough.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> As for
drink, with the exception of the coffee, pronounced
"famous," the unanimous verdict
was that it was execrable, neither wine nor
beer, only stagnant water; "and they say,
besides, that the Boches have poisoned it."
The men were recommended only to drink it
in their coffee, well boiled. "I lived for days
on bread and sugar, with a cup of coffee for
an occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> treat," wrote Alfred de Nanteuil.
"All the water in the district is polluted.
So I go very well for a week without drinking
anything but coffee." François Alain, for
one, was four days without food or drink,
lying among the straw in a barn where twenty-seven
of his comrades had been bayoneted.
How did this nineteen-year-old conscript
escape the Boches who had remained in the
neighbourhood? Through a little hole he
had made with his knife in one of the tiles of
the roof he observed all their movements,
and took note of their trenches and the emplacements
of their cannon and their machine-guns;
and one fine night, when there was
not too much moonlight, he crawled out,
killing a German officer who was reconnoitring
the French positions, and got back into our
lines with a cargo of precious information, a
thick coating of mud, and teeth sharpened by a
fast of ninety-six hours.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> And these men,
dripping with wet, with empty stomachs and
burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> heads, never lost heart for a moment.
The same note recurs in all their letters:
"In spite of this, all goes well, and we are not
downhearted, especially when we can have a
go at the Boches." The one thing consoles
them for the other. They know the perils of
the trenches, and they prefer them to the
inactivity of being kept in reserve. "We
have had twelve days of fighting now,"
wrote the Marine C., of Audierne, "and this
evening, I am glad to say, we are to be in the
first line, for it is better to be under fire than
resting." Was this paradox or braggadocio?
Not at all. They spoke as they thought.
They courted danger as other men shun it.</p>

speech made at the funeral of this brave officer at Lannion
by Second-Lieutenant de Cuverville, representing Admiral
Berryer: "The order to mobilise found Ernest Eno at
Brest, engaged in training those very battalions he was
later to lead against the enemy; and no one could have
been better qualified than he to give our young recruits
not only professional instruction, but those lessons of
manliness and patriotism which go to the heart, and make
men strong and courageous. For he was himself a hero.
A self-made man, he had raised himself step by step on
the steep ladder of his calling. He was a true sailor. He
went off with the 1st Regiment of Marines on August 13....
He fell at the head of his men under intense fire
round the cemetery of Dixmude, his thigh fractured by a
fragment of shell. He was not fated to recover from his
terrible wound. He died, uniting in his last prayers to
God his dear ones and his beloved Brittany, which he was
to see no more." An operation had been performed on
Eno on the battlefield by his fellow-citizen and friend
Dr. Taburet, one of the doctors of the brigade, who showed
the most supreme contempt of danger under fire in
attendance on our wounded.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> Dr. Caradec, <i>op. cit.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> In less critical circumstances the same accident had
happened to Second-Lieutenant Gautier, and was the
occasion of an amusing little scene, which might have been
taken from Léonec and Gervèze's sketches of Marines:
"Yesterday I was going at the Germans with machine-guns
at 1,200 metres on a road from which I finally cut
them off. All of a sudden the guns jammed. I yelled
from my blockhouse: 'What's the matter?' 'Guns
jammed.' 'Tell the gunner from me that he's an ass.'
The communicator, a worthy Breton fisherman, repeated
gravely: 'The Lieutenant says that the gunner is an ass.'
The gunner was one Primat. A few days later, on
November 10, in submerged Dixmude, this same Primat
(the orderly of the Second-Lieutenant), who had survived
his officer, used his machine-guns with such skill and coolness
against a German column that he stopped it dead,
mowing down three sections."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> This story is told by the Marine Georges Delaballe.
Such was the ardour communicated by Des Pallières to his
men, that the next day a Marine and a Boche were found
"lying dead one upon the other, the Marine's fingers thrust
through the German's cheek, and still clutching it." A stray
bullet had killed them both. What had exasperated the
Marines was that the major who led the attack wore a large
Red Cross armlet. Their native honesty was revolted by
this constant recourse to ignoble ruses, by which our enemies
have dishonoured even their own heroism. Martin des
Pallières was the nephew of the Admiral who commanded
the Marines in 1870. "He was a brave man, whose courage
was combined with great simplicity and gaiety. He was
killed by a big shell in the middle of the group of machine-guns
he was working under a furious fire," writes a correspondent.
Dr. Caradec points out that this night of
October 26 was particularly tragic; and in support of this
statement he quotes an incident horrible enough, indeed,
from the narrative of the naval mechanician Le L.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Germans had taken some French trenches, and
shells were raining thickly upon us. All of a sudden some
of our men were engulfed in a mass of <i>débris</i>. As one of
my friends was half buried in the earth, I and another
went to help him; but a shell fell right upon him, and I
in my turn was buried up to the neck. Night was coming
on fast. I spent fourteen hours of anguish in this position.
Furious fighting was going on. Two friends were moaning
near me. The one nearest begged me to help him, but
I was held fast as in a vice, and had to look on helpless as
he died. My own strength began to fail. I became
unconscious a few hours after I had been buried. What
made me suffer most was to see the Germans a few yards
from me. I could see all they were doing, all their death-dealing
preparations. During the night the Senegalese
riflemen retook our lost trenches; they set to work to
clear away the rubbish and found my two dead friends near
me. One of the Senegalese stepped on my head. Feeling
something under his feet, he bent down and saw me. They
got me out and took me to the first ambulance. In a few
hours I was fully conscious again. You can imagine how I
rejoiced to find myself among friends. I felt like one risen
from the dead."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> Among them was Second-Lieutenant Gautier. The
following order, communicated to us by his family, was
found with his papers: "Monsieur Gautier,&mdash;By superior
orders, I am sending a section to relieve you, and to instruct
you to go with your section near the cemetery, behind the
wall or on the railway embankment, as may seem best to
you and to the officer in the adjoining trenches. Des
Pallières' section, which was in the cemetery, has been
annihilated, Des Pallières himself killed and buried in the
<i>débris</i> of the trench." Second-Lieutenant Gautier was killed
at 9 o'clock in the evening. "We were having our dinner
in the trench," wrote Lieutenant Gamas a few days later,
"when the order came for him to go to a dangerous position
to replace Des Pallières, who had just been killed there.
The last words your son-in-law said to me were: 'Captain,
it's my turn.' We shook hands warmly, looking affectionately
at each other. The next day I heard that my poor
friend was dead. He had been hit in the forehead by a
German bullet at the moment when, attacked by very
superior numbers with three machine-gun sections, he had
put his head out in order to regulate his fire and do his
duty thoroughly. He fell nobly, leaving a glorious and
honoured name to his wife and children."</p></div>

<h2>XI. THE ATTACK ON THE CHÂTEAU DE WOUMEN</h2>


<p>All Saints' Day was nearly as quiet
as the preceding forty-eight hours.
We re-established our trenches, and
the Admiral reorganised his regiments and
transferred his headquarters to Oudecappelle.
In his journal Alfred de Nanteuil,
who had been with our second line from
the day before, notices the truce from
<i>marmites</i>, if not from shrapnel and bullets,
"singing past a little like summer flies." But
farms were blazing all round the vast horizon,
lighting up the November night and accentuating
the fact that, although the enemy's
attentions had changed in form, they had put
on no amenity. "One of my men," says De
Nanteuil, "found the severed hand of a
small child in a German's knapsack...."
And at Eessen, where the <i>vicaire</i> was a young
priest of twenty-eight, the Abbé Deman, his
murderers amused themselves by forcing him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to dig his own grave before they shot him in
the graveyard of his own church.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>A day later the temporary inertia of the
enemy was explained. A few <i>marmites</i> on our
trenches and on the farms occupied by our
supply services were not enough to deceive us.
We had been aware for several days of a
continuous growling in the south-west, on the
Ypres road. The enemy had transferred a
part of his forces towards Mercken, where he
was seeking contact with our Territorials and
with the British troops. It seemed a good
opportunity to break the iron girdle which
held us and to afford some relief to our
positions. The <i>moral</i> of our men had never
been better. Rumours of a general offensive
were current in the brigade, and nothing
stimulates the French soldier more than the
hope of an advance. On November 3 French
aeroplanes passed over Dixmude, towards the
German lines, and a balloon was hanging in
the sky towards the west.</p>

<p>"Happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> omen!" wrote De Nanteuil. "We
have been without such encouragements all
through the long defence.... Now my spirits
rise. Everything points to an advance. The
<i>marmites</i> have disappeared, for which no one
is sorry. I have been in the first line since
last night. The sun is shining; the lark is
singing; the mud is drying. We are fearful to
behold. Relieved by the Belgians in the
night, I have to find and guide those who have
to take the place of my company. On my
way back, worn out, I stop a barrel of Belgian
soup and have a delicious pull at it. My
battalion is in reserve since last night. Passed
the night in a barn, men in the trench.
To-day it has been a case of 'packs on' ever
since the morning."</p>

<p>"Where are we off to?" said this intrepid
officer to himself. "Perhaps," he thought,
"nowhere! Anyway, the guns are raging,
and this time it is our own beloved guns,
which we have awaited so impatiently. I
cannot hear the others; I think it is all
right."</p>

<p>Alfred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> de Nanteuil was not mistaken.
This time it was our 75's which led the dance.
The General had decided that an attack
should debouch from the town "supported by
a powerful mass of artillery and having for
main objective the Château on the road to
Woumen, about a kilometre from Dixmude."
The attack was to be made by four battalions
of infantry of the 42nd Division, a Marine
battalion under Commandant de Jonquières
acting as support, and the rest of the brigade
as reserve. The whole was under the command
of General Grossetti&mdash;Grossetti the
invulnerable, as he had been called ever since
his splendid defence of Pervyse, where he
faced the shells sitting on a camp-stool.</p>

<p>The attack began about eight o'clock by
an energetic clearing of the whole position.
There was, perhaps, some little hesitation in
the movements which followed. The fact
is that by not moving off until half-past eleven
in the morning our infantry lost much of the
advantage given by the artillery preparation.
The enemy had had time to pull himself together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
The eighth battalion of Chasseurs
could not debouch from the cemetery by the
Woumen road until supported by the De
Jonquières battalion. Then it was checked
at the end of 200 metres. At the same time
the 151st Infantry had made good a similar
advance on the Eessen road. That was the total
gain of the day. We renewed the offensive at
3 next morning, but with no more success
than the day before. The attack always
lacked "go." We scarcely advanced at all,
well supported as we were by our 75's, which
once more showed their superiority over the
German artillery. The General now determined
to reinforce the attack with the
whole 42nd Division and two fresh battalions
of Marines. A day was taken up by preparations
for the passage of the Yser, a
kilometre below Dixmude. For this purpose
two flying bridges were brought down from
the town. There was a thick fog, the best
sort of weather for such an operation. One
of the Marine battalions was directed to
attack on a line parallel to the Yser. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
remaining two, crossing higher up, were to
make straight for the Château, while the
8th Chasseurs were to prolong the attack to
the north. Fifty guns concentrated their fire
on the buildings and the ground immediately
about them. But this enchanted castle, with
its fougasses, its deep trenches, its lines of
barbed wire, its loopholed walls, its machine-guns
on every storey, and its flanking fire, gave
out a sort of repelling electricity which had
the effect, if not of destroying the <i>élan</i> of our
troops, at least of curiously blunting it. The
ground, seamed with watercourses, was unfavourable,
and trouble brooded in the fog.
In short, when night fell we were still a quarter
of a mile from the Château; we had not even
reached the park. On the Eessen side we
had made no progress. Finally, the Belgians
near Beerst, who were defending the north
front of Dixmude, sent word that they were
no longer enough to man the trenches, and
the Admiral had to send to their help two
companies of the De Kerros battalion from the
first reserve. This unwelcome necessity was
made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> up for by the arrival of two long 120-mm.
pieces, which were at once put in battery
south of the level crossing at Caeskerke.</p>

<p>However, the night of November 5 was
quiet all round Dixmude; but at dawn the
attack was renewed. This time we had good
reason to hope for success. Rising from the
provisional trenches, our battalions moved
simultaneously in echelon across the plain.
The charge sounded, shouts of "Vive la
France!" broke out, and, in spite of terrible
machine-gun and rifle fire, the farm and the
park were carried with a rush. Our men were
at the foot of the Château. But there the
rush was stopped. Contrary to report, the
Château was not taken. The internal defences
had been organised in the most formidable
way, perhaps even before the war began.
The enemy left in our hands some hundred
prisoners, who had been barricaded in the
pavilion at the main gate.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> At nightfall
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> order was given to retire. The De Jonquières
battalion returned to its billets. The
42nd Division went off in another direction,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
and the brigade was again left alone at Dixmude
with a handful of Senegalese and the Belgians.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>"We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> don't budge," writes De Nanteuil on
November 6. "Our reinforcements are being
sent back. Visited the church and Hôtel
de Ville of Dixmude. Frightful! They are
nothing but shapeless ruins. There is not
a whole house left. Certain quarters are
destroyed down to their very foundations;
they are nothing but heaps of stone and
bricks.... Messina is in better case than
this unhappy town."</p>

account of the closing scenes of the attack we have followed
the narrative of the correspondent of <i>La Liberté</i>, which
appeared to us trustworthy. This correspondent says, "They
[the prisoners] had no time to retreat, so sudden and furious
was the attack. Carried away by their excitement, the
Marines never saw that the pavilion was full of Germans.
It was not until three hours later that a Prussian non-commissioned
officer walked unarmed out of the building and surrendered
with his party to the first French officer he met."
We have been authoritatively told that nothing of the kind
took place. "The attack reached the Château, but failed to

tranquillity. "It rains," writes Alfred de Nanteuil
on the 4th, "five hours drawn up on the road, fully
accoutred. Mud frightful. Walked through Dixmude&mdash;a
vision of horror, lights of pillagers, carcases, indescribable ruins....
Passed the night at a deserted farm, full of corpses,
utterly sacked and ruined. Plenty of evidence that the
owners were well-behaved, pious, and honest Belgian cultivators.
The night fairly calm, so we had six hours of sleep
in our wet clothes. Impossible to change." The 5th:
"To-day the weather beautiful, the sun shining. Everything
calm. In the watercourses we see reflected the
vaporous landscapes of the great Flemish masters. The
cattle which have escaped the bombardment stand about on
the dykes. At last one is able to breathe, ... to be glad
one lives. I begin to think we shall be here for a long
time."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<h2>XII. THE DEATH OF DIXMUDE</h2>


<p>She is not quite dead yet, however.
Scalped, shattered, and burnt as she
is, she still holds a spark of life as
long as we are there. This charnel-house in
which we are encamped, with its streets,
which are nothing but malodorous paths
winding among corpses, heaps of broken stone
and brick, and craters opened by the Boche
<i>marmites</i>, still beats with life in its depths.
Existence has become subterranean. Dixmude
has catacombs into which our men pour
when they leave the trenches. And they are
not all soldiers who explore the recesses of
these vaults and cellars. The suspicious
lights alluded to by Alfred de Nanteuil are
not, perhaps, always carried by pillagers.
Mysteriously enough, one house in the town
has escaped the bombardment. It is the
flour factory near the bridge, and its cement
platform still dominates the valley of the Yser.</p>

<p>The 42nd Division left us two of its batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of 75's when it moved off. That was something,
of course, though not enough to make
up for the disablement of 58 out of the 72 guns
we originally had for the defence of our front.
The only formidable guns we have are the
heavy ones, but they are without the mobility
of the 75's. And now apparently our attack
on the Château of Woumen has disquieted
the Germans, who are again in force before
Dixmude. The bombardment of the town
and of the trenches has recommenced, and
last night we had to repulse a pretty lively
attack on our trenches at the cemetery.
There is also pressure along the Eessen road,
with considerable losses at both points. A
renewal of the attack to-night seems probable.
And our ranks are already thin!<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>"Mother,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> writes a Marine from Dixmude
on November 7, "it is with my cartridge
belt on my back and sheltered from the
German machine-guns that I send you these
few lines to say that my news is good, and
that I hope it is the same with you and the
family. But, mother, I don't expect that
either you or the family will ever see me
again. None of us will come back. But I
shall have given my life in doing my duty as
a French soldier-sailor. I have already had
two bullets, one in the sleeve of my great-coat,
the other in my right cartridge case. The
third will do better."</p>

<p>On the same day another Marine writes
home: "Out of our squad of 16, we still
have three left." However, the night of the
6th and the day which followed were quiet
enough. The disappointment caused by the
failure of our attack on the Château was already
almost forgotten, and our hopes were again
rising.</p>

<p>"I think," wrote Alfred de Nanteuil, "that
my company will not stir from this for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
time. I have to furnish reinforcing parties as
they are wanted, the rest of my men and myself
staying in the trench, which we are always
improving. We have a farmhouse near by
which allows us to eat in comfort. And we
have plenty of straw."</p>

<p>The general impression is that we are held
from one end of the front to the other.
"Bombardment always and musketry, a
siege war, in short. It will come to an end
some day. Meanwhile," says De Nanteuil,
gaily, "our spirits and health are good."
But this very afternoon certain suspicious
movements were descried on the further bank
of the Yser. As it was easy to bombard this
part of the hostile front, a gun was promptly
trained in that direction. Was it a decoy,
or was some spy from behind sending signals?
The gun no sooner came into action than a
German battery was unmasked upon it, killing
Captain Marcotte de Sainte-Marie, who was
controlling the fire.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Thenceforward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> attacks never ceased. The
night between the 7th and 8th was nothing
but a long series of attempts on our front,
which were all repulsed. They began again at
daylight against the trenches at the cemetery.
There the enclosing wall had been battered
down for some time past by the German
artillery. Through the loopholes in our
parapets one could see the wide stretch of
beetroots on the edge of which we were
fighting, our backs to Dixmude. Away on
the horizon the Château of Woumen, on its
solitary height, rose from the surrounding
woods and dominated the position. Little
clouds of white smoke hung from the trees,
which seemed to be shedding down. In his
invariable fashion, the enemy was preparing
his attacks by a systematic clearing of the
ground; shrapnel and <i>marmites</i> were smashing
the tombstones, decapitating the crosses,
breaking up the iron grilles, the crowns of
<i>immortelles</i>, and the coffins themselves. The
Flemish subsoil is so permeable that coffins
are not sunk more than a couple of feet below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the surface, so that their occupants were
strewn about in a frightful way. Several
Marines were wounded by splinters of bone
from these mobilised corpses.... In the
fogs of Flanders, when the mystery of night
and the great disc of the moon added their
phantasmagoria to the scene, all this surpassed
in <i>macabre</i> horror the most ghastly
inventions of romantic fiction and legend.
Familiar as our Bretons were with supernatural
ideas, they shivered at it all, and
welcomed an attack as a relief from continual
nightmare.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>"Although we did not give way at all,"
writes a Marine, "we understood that everyone
was not made like ourselves and the
Senegalese. We took pity on the poor worn-out
Belgians, who had come to the end of
their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> tether, especially their foot Chasseurs,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
and we took their places in the trenches.
We had three <i>aviatiks</i> continually hanging
over us,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> at which we fired in vain. They
returned every day at the same hour, as
surely as poverty to the world. As soon as
they had gone back we knew what to expect.
Down came the <i>marmites</i> on our
devoted heads!"</p>

<p>And their music, compared to the gentle
coughing of our little Belgian guns! At last a
dozen new 75's appeared on the scene and
relieved these poor asthmatics. They were
distributed between Caeskerke and the Yser.
Our grim point was the cemetery. There
one of our trenches had been taken by the
Germans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> but a vigorous counter-attack, led
by Second-Lieutenant Melchior, soon turned
them out. "Exasperated by so many sterile
efforts," writes Lieutenant A., "the enemy
decided, on November 10, to make a decisive
stroke. Towards ten in the morning began
the most terrible bombardment the brigade
had yet had to suffer. The fire was very
accurate, destroying the trenches and causing
great losses."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> At 11 o'clock 12,000 Germans,
Mausers at the charge, advanced against
Dixmude.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>This attack repeated the tactics of the early
days of the siege. The Germans came on in
heavy masses, reinforced by fresh troops.
They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> had also learnt the weak points of their
opponents. And yet it is not certain that the
attack would have succeeded had it not
been for the unexpected giving way of our
positions on the Eessen road.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This was the
only part of the southern sector not defended
by Marines. It must have been entirely
smashed up, with the Senegalese who flanked
it on both wings. As a fact, the enemy's fire
was so intense along the whole line and our
reply so feeble, that Alfred de Nanteuil, who
occupied a trench in rear of the northern
sector, had to withdraw his men behind a
haystack. "Impossible to lift one's nose
above the ground," writes an officer, "so
thick and fast came the shells." The attacking
column was thus enabled to pass the canal
at Handzaeme and to fall upon the flank of
the trenches occupied by the eleventh company.
This company had been engaging the batteries
at Korteckeer and Kasterthoeck, on their left,
and a violent rifle and machine-gun fire from
a group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> of farms higher up the canal. What
was left of it had barely time to fall back upon
its neighbours, the ninth and tenth companies.
A hostile detachment, creeping along the
canal, had contrived to push as far as the command
post of the third battalion, taking possession
on the way of Dr. Guillet's ambulance,
which had been established at the end of the
Roman bridge. Our trenches were not connected
by telephone, and communications had
broken down. Four marines only, out of the 60
in the reserve of Commander Rabot, succeeded
in escaping. The sentry on the roof of the
farm in which they were waiting saw the
enemy coming and gave the alarm: "The
Boches&mdash;quarter of a mile away!" "To
arms!" shouted De Nanteuil. "Into the
trenches!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/i191.jpg" width="444" height="600" alt="OLD HOUSES ON THE HANDZAEME CANAL" title="" />
<span class="caption">OLD HOUSES ON THE HANDZAEME CANAL</span>
</div>

<p>He himself went to an exposed point to
observe the enemy. There a bullet hit him in
the neck, striking the spinal marrow. How his
men contrived to bring him off it is difficult to
say. He remained conscious and had no illusions
as to his state. All his energy seemed
concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> on the desire to die in France.
He had his wish.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Then came the final defeat. The lines on
the Eessen road driven in, the dyke pierced
at the centre, the northern sector cut off from
the south, the German wave flowed over us.
The enemy had penetrated to the heart of our
defence, and, being continuously reinforced,
swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> round our flanks and took us in reverse.
One after another our positions gave way.
Already the first fugitives were arriving before
Dixmude.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to?" cries an officer as
he bars the way to a sailor.</p>

<p>"Captain, a shell has smashed my rifle.
Give me another, and I'll go back."</p>

<p>They give him one, and he returns to the
inferno. Another, wandering on the field like
a soul in torture, replies to the inquiry of an
officer that he is "looking for his company.
There cannot be much of it left, but,"
straightening himself, "that does not matter:
<i>they</i> shall not get through!"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>And they do not get through. But it was
too late to stop them from entering Dixmude.
Their musketry was all round us, a rifle behind
every heap of rubble, a machine-gun at every
point of vantage. The sharp note of the
German trumpet sounded from every side.
It is possible that a certain number of the
enemy who had lain hidden in the cellars of
Dixmude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> ever since the fighting on the 25th
now came out of their earth to add to the
confusion. The truth of this will be known
some day. We were under fire in the town,
outside the town, on the canal, on the Yser.
It was street fighting, with all its ambuscades
and surprises. What had become of the
covering troops in the cemetery and on the
Beerst road? Of the reserve under Commander
Rabot, driven from ditch to ditch,
its commander killed or missing,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> only fifteen
men were left. These were rallied by Lieutenant
Sérieyx in a muddy ditch, where they
fought to the last man. Surrounded and
disarmed, Sérieyx and some others were
forced to act as a shield to the Germans who
were advancing against the junction of the
canal and the Yser. "Abominable sight,"
says Lieutenant A., "French prisoners compelled
to march in front of Boches, who
knelt behind them and fired between their
legs!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> Our men beyond the Yser could not
reply.</p>

<p>"Call to them to surrender," ordered the
German major to Sérieyx.</p>

<p>"Why should you think they will surrender?
There are ten thousand of them!"<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>There were really two hundred!</p>

<p>At this moment a sudden burst of fire on
the right distracted the enemy's attention.
With a sign to the others, Sérieyx, whose arm
had already been broken by a bullet, threw
himself into the Yser, succeeded in swimming
across, and at once made his way to the
Admiral to report what was happening.</p>

<p>A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> counter-attack ordered by the officer in
command of the defence and led by Lieutenant
d'Albia had covered his escape. The eighth
company, in reserve, reinforced by a section
of the fifth company of the 2nd Regiment,
under Commander Mauros and Lieutenant
Daniel, entrenched itself behind the barricade
at the level crossing on the Eessen road.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
On all the roads leading to the Yser, and
especially at the three bridges, sections
strongly established themselves or helped to
consolidate sections already there. Would
these dispositions, hastily taken by Commandant
Delage, be enough to save Dixmude?
At most they could only prolong the agony.
Her hours were numbered. After having
driven its way through the hostile column
which had reached the Yser, Lieutenant
d'Albia's section encountered more Germans
debouching from the Grand' Place and
neighbouring streets. Germans and Frenchmen
now formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> nothing but a mass of
shouting men. They shot each other at close
quarters; they fought with their bayonets,
their knives, their clubbed rifles, and when
these were broken, with their fists, with their
feet, even with their teeth. By three in the
afternoon we had lost one half of our men,
killed, wounded, or prisoners. The German
columns were still pouring into Dixmude
through the breaches in the defence. They
pushed us back to the bridges, which we still
held, which we were indeed to hold to the end.
They were going to take Dixmude, but the little
sailor was right: they were not going to pass
the Yser. One more attack was organised to
bring off the Mauros company, which was
retiring under a terrible fire. The remains of
several sections were brought together, and,
led by their officers, they charged into the
<i>mêlée</i> in the streets. One purple-faced,
sweating Marine, who had seen his brother
fall, swore he would have the blood of twenty
Boches. He went for them with the bayonet,
counting "One! two! three!" etc., till he
had reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> twenty-two. After that he returned
to his company, a madman.</p>

<p>But what could the finest heroism do against
the swarms of men who rose, as it were, from
the earth as fast as they were crushed?
"They are like bugs," sighed a quartermaster,
and night was coming on. Dixmude
had ceased to give signs of life. For six
hours fighting had gone on over a dismembered
corpse. Not a gable, not a wall, was left
standing, except those of the flour factory. To
hold these heaps of rubbish, which might turn
into a focus of infection, was not worth the
little finger of one of our men. At 5 o'clock
in the evening, after blowing up the bridges
and the flour factory, the Admiral retired
behind the Yser.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>"Dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> mother," wrote a Marine a few days
later from Audierne, "I have to tell you
that on the 10th of this month I was not
cheering much at Dixmude, for out of the
whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> of my company only 30 returned. I
never expected to come out, but with a stout
heart I managed to get away. I had a very
bad time. Many of us had to swim to save
ourselves." These, no doubt, were the
prisoners who had thrown themselves into
the canal with the heroic Sérieyx.</p>

<p>All this time Lieutenant Cantener, who
had taken command on the death of his
senior officer, had been maintaining himself
on the Beerst road, with three companies of
Marines. At nightfall he had the satisfaction&mdash;and
the credit&mdash;of bringing nearly the
whole of his command safely into our lines.
They had made their way by ditches full of
water and mud up to their waists. They were
450 in all&mdash;450 blocks of mud&mdash;and they were
not, as has been said, worn out and without
arms and equipment, but steadily marching in
fours, bayonets fixed, and as calm as on parade.
They had their wounded in front, and each
company had its rear-guard.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> many of our men were left beneath
the ruins of the town or in the hands of the
enemy, but they had not been vainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
After losing some 10,000 men,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> the
Germans found themselves in possession of a
town reduced to mere heaps of rubbish with
an impregnable line beyond. Our reserve
lines had become our front, well furnished with
heavy guns, and punctually supported by the
inundation which stretched its impassable
defence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> both to north and south. The whole
valley of the Lower Yser had become a tideless
sea, out into which stood Dixmude, like a
crumbling headland. In taking it the Germans
had simply made themselves masters of
two <i>têtes de pont</i>. Even that is saying too
much, for we still commanded the place from
the northern bank of the Yser, and our
artillery, under General Coffec, frustrated all
attempts to organise their capture. Meanwhile
thousands of Germans, between the
Yser and the embankment of the Nieuport
railway, watched with apprehension the water
rising about the mounds up which they had
hauled their mortars and machine-guns. In
the immediate neighbourhood of Dixmude,
where the Admiral had caused the sluice at
the sixteenth milestone to be blown up,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> a
hostile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> column of some fifteen hundred men
was overwhelmed by the water together with
the patch of raised ground on which it had
taken refuge.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> A fresh inundation added
greatly to the extent of the floods, and
practically reconstituted the old <i>schoore</i> of
Dixmude. All danger of the enemy's making
good the passage of the river had finally
passed away.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> For the period between October 24 and November 6
the names of the following officers who fell must be added
to those already given: killed or dead of their wounds,
Lieutenants Cherdel and Richard, Second-Lieutenants Rousset
and Le Coq; among those wounded, but not mortally,
Lieutenants Antoine, "son of Admiral Antoine and the
model of a perfect officer" (private correspondence), and
Revel, who, when severely wounded in the thigh, ordered
his decimated company to retire, "leaving him in the
trench where he had fallen."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_64_64" id="Footnote_64_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> Marcotte de Sainte-Marie was provisionally succeeded
at the head of his battalion by Lieutenant Dordet, who
acquitted himself admirably.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> And yet these cemetery trenches afforded comparative
security. Before reaching them it was necessary to cross a
perfectly flat zone of 60 metres, continually swept by rifle
fire and shrapnel. "This we passed at the double, in
Indian file, our knapsacks on our heads, and popped, those
who had not been left on the way, into the cellars under
the caretaker's house with an 'Ouf!' of relief." (Georges
Delaballe.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> It must be remembered that the Belgians had been
fighting for three solid months, and that until the 23rd
October they had faced the Germans alone, if not at Dixmude
at least as far north as Nieuport.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_67_67" id="Footnote_67_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> To say nothing of a captive balloon. "Violent
bombardment of our trenches, directed by 'sausage'
balloons; feeble reply of French and Belgian artillery,"
is the entry, under date of the 8th, in an officer's note-book,
where also we find under date of the 9th:
"Bombardment continued. Night attack on the outposts,
which were driven in."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_68_68" id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> Dr. Caradec says the German artillery, consisting of
batteries of 105's and 77's, was posted 2,000 metres away,
behind the Château of Woumen, and near Vladsloo,
Korteckeer, and Kasterthoeck.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_69_69" id="Footnote_69_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> Before that, however, at half-past nine, a lively attack
had been directed against the front of the ninth and tenth
companies of the 1st Regiment, which occupied towards
Beerst one end of the arc described round Dixmude by our
trenches; the extremities of this arc rested on the Yser.
The Germans tried to push between the Yser and the flank
of the ninth company. This attack was repulsed by the two
companies, assisted by fire from the remaining trenches
and a battery of 75's.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> Rather above Dixmude station, between the railway
embankment and the Eessen road.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> We find in the <i>Bulletin de la Société Archéologique du
Finisterre</i> that "M. de Nanteuil, a retired naval officer,
returned to the service in the first days of the war and was
attached to the defence of Brest and its neighbourhood.
But this occupation seemed to him too quiet, and, in spite
of a precarious state of health, he left no stone unturned to get
to the front. Fifteen days after arriving there he was killed,
one hero more in a family of heroes. He was an efficient
archæologist, especially in all that had to do with military
architecture. He had published some excellent papers on
our old feudal castles in the <i>Bulletins</i> of the <i>Association
Bretonne</i>, historical notes and descriptions relating to the
Château of Brest, the remains at Morlaix and Saint Pol de
Léon, the churches of Guimilian, Lampaul, Saint Thégonnec,
and Pleyben...." He went off full of pluck and go, we
hear from another source, his heart full of eagerness to meet
the enemy. Those friends who saw him off all noticed his
radiant looks.... When mortally wounded, for paralysis
supervened almost at once, and carried to the ambulance,
his head was still clear, he was anxious as to the phases of
the battle, and asked whether the enemy had been repulsed.
He supported his sufferings without complaint, and in the
evening, although he was very weak, they moved him on to
Malo-les-Bains, for he "wished to die on French ground."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> Dr. Caradec, <i>op. cit.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73_73" id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> He was killed. He had been hit by a bullet above
the ear as he raised himself to glance round over the high
bank of a watercourse lined by his men.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> To this major Sérieyx had only surrendered after all
his ammunition was exhausted, and he and his men saw that no
further resistance was possible. The major had then asked
Sérieyx whether there was no means of crossing the Yser.
Sérieyx answered, "I only know of one, the Haut Pont."
Now, at some fifty yards from where they stood, there was
a footbridge which our sailors were at that moment crossing.
Sérieyx held the major's attention by taking a pencil and
tracing a complicated plan of the position. From time to
time firing took place, and the Frenchmen planted themselves
stoically in front of the Boches, Sérieyx working
away at his plan. But the major grew impatient at its
complication, and thought it better to make use of his
prisoner to procure the surrender of the trenches.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> "The troops in the southern sector moved back towards
the town, defending themselves by a series of barricades,
under the orders of Commander Mauros and Lieutenant
Daniel." (Note-book of Second-Lieutenant X.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_76_76" id="Footnote_76_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> It has been said that an old woman caused the fall of
Dixmude on November 10. "The allied forces occupying
Dixmude," said the <i>Daily Mail</i>, "consisted of a
squadron of cavalry encamped on the right bank of the Yser,
two batteries of 75's, a regiment of infantry, and a battalion
of Zouaves (!). The battle began with a violent cannonade,
which had the great distillery in the centre of the town as
its principal objective. Two of our 75's were on the first
floor of a tannery, the others below, on a little mound
where skins were cleaned. Our artillery was able to hold
the enemy in check, opening great breaches through the
hostile ranks with its shells. One German gun lost all its
team, and the Uhlans were mown down by our sailors. Our
men, cavalry and infantry, were awaiting the word to attack.
Just at this moment appeared an old woman to whom our
Zouaves had been kind, as she seemed so miserable. She
had marched with them, leaning on the arm of one and
another and sharing their soup. She mounted to the first
floor of the tannery, and then disappeared. A moment
later a light appeared on the roof of the distillery. It was
seen to swing three times from right to left. Five minutes
later the German shells began to rain upon the point
indicated by the light. In a very short time the building
was greatly damaged, fires broke out, and the burning
alcohol lighted up the whole neighbourhood. Unable to
stem either the deluge of shells or this conflagration, the
French general decided to evacuate the town and entrench
himself on the canal banks. With great difficulty the 75's
were withdrawn from their positions. Before quitting the
city the French soldiers saw, and were able to identify, the
'old woman,' stretched on the ground, with the uniform of
an Uhlan peeping from beneath 'her' skirts." This is all
pure imagination. Spies certainly played a part in the fall
of Dixmude. Too many people were accepted as refugees
and distressed inhabitants who were in reality the guides
and accomplices of the enemy. But, in the first place, we
had no Zouaves at Dixmude; secondly, our observation post
was not in a tannery; finally, we had no cavalry. The
only body which barred the way to the Germans was the
Marines, omitted in this account.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_77_77" id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> The following details of this fine operation have reached
me, but before giving them I must remind the reader that
the Germans who fell upon the reserve under Commander
Rabot did not destroy Company 11. This company, after
a lively exchange of fire, retired upon Companies 9 and 10,
which were almost intact. Dixmude had already fallen,
when the captains of the three companies met, and after
thinking over the situation, determined to hold on at all
costs. Consequently "Company 10 proceeded to place a
small advanced post on the Beerst road, with two double
sentries, and a rear-guard at the old mill. The company
itself was drawn up with one rank facing to the front, the
other to the rear, and the trenches so arranged that a front
could be shown in any direction. The machine-guns
abandoned by the Belgians were overhauled and placed so
as to sweep the Beerst road. At 6.30 the little northern
post was attacked. Pursuant to orders, it retired after a
volley or two. Then fire opened along the whole line, the
machine-guns of Company 10 joining in. The Germans,
who expected no such stubborn resistance, had severe losses.
For an hour the fight lasted without change, the men still
at their post and the trench still intact. All the killed,
Captain Baudry among them, were shot through the head,
the wounded, in the head or the arm, in the act of firing.
At this moment the beginning of an attack from the rear made
itself felt. The time for retreat had come, as the detachment
had lost connection with the Staff of the battalion. The
companies moved off successively, each leaving a section to
protect its retreat. This retreat was admirable, but quite indescribable
on account of the ground. <i>Arroyos</i> (mud-holes)
everywhere. The men got through, although sinking to their
armpits and handing on their wounded before them. After
two hours of this painful but orderly progression, they arrived
before the footbridge over the Yser. A farm granary arose
near by, where the Germans had mounted machine-guns to
sweep the bridge. Lieutenant Cantener, who was now in
command, decided to carry the farm. The operation was a
complete success. The Germans were driven out, the farm
burnt, and the Yser crossed. The column, with its wounded
in front, then made its way safely to the cross-roads at
Caeskerke, and thence into the shelter trenches at Oudecappelle."
The third battalion of the 1st Regiment, which
held the northern sector, had the following officers: Company
9, Berat, Poisson, Le Gall; Company 10, Baudry, Mazen,
Devisse; Company 11, Cantener, Hillairet, Le Provost;
Company 12, De Nanteuil, Vielhomme, Charrier.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> According to M. Pierre Loti, the Marines at Dixmude
lost "half their effective and from 80 to 100 of their
officers." This estimate is none too large if we include the
wounded and missing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> According to the <i>Nieuws van den Dag</i>, 4,000 wounded
were sent to Liège the next day. Another Dutch journal,
the <i>Telegraaf</i>, says that out of 3,000 men engaged in the
attack on the southern sector of the defence "only a hundred
men were left after the fall of the town." All estimates
are clearly uncertain in such confused affairs, and so we
have taken our figures preferably from the neutral press,
in which we may look for a certain amount of impartiality.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_80_80" id="Footnote_80_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> The operation was carried out by Quartermaster Le
Bellé to whom the military medal was awarded. "A night
or two ago," writes Commander Geynet, "I was ordered to
blow up the sluice in front of me.... A little quartermaster
crossed the stream on a plank nailed across two barrels. We
pushed the Prussians out of the way by rifle fire. My
little man, with his charge of dynamite, chose his moment
well, then, leaving his raft to draw the fire of the Prussians,
regained our bank by swimming."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_81_81" id="Footnote_81_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> Paul Chautard in the <i>Liberté</i> of November 24.
Commander Geynet says nothing of this episode, however.</p></div>
